title: "Should we offer genetic testing on every ALS case?"
---

Since effective treatments of selected genetic ALS variants became available, the questions whether we should test every (suspected sporadic) case becomes much more relevant. International guidelines are not yet aligned in their recommendations (the [German](https://www.dgn.org/leitlinie/motoneuronerkrankungen ) and [EFNS guidelines](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-1331.2011.03501.x) only recommend for suspected familial cases, while one [American guideline](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10646996/) includes the recommendation to offer genetic testing to all patients)
