title: "Should everybody get the VZV vaccine for dementia prevention?"
---

Multiple epidemiological studies suggest a link between varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation and subsequent dementia risk as well as a reduction of dementia risk following vaccination. Most of the studies looked at older populations. The question remains if just everybody should get vaccinated against VZV to reduce their dementia risk.
