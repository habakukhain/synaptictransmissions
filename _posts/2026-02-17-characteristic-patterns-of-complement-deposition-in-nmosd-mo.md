summary: "Histopathological analysis of CNS tissues reveals distinct complement deposition patterns in NMOSD, MOGAD, and MS that reflect their different pathogenic mechanisms. Most importantly, MOGAD shows two distinct pathological subtypes based on complement activation intensity, with the more destructive type B pattern associated with mortality."

**Problem**: The role of complement in MOGAD and MS pathogenesis remains unclear despite established complement involvement in NMOSD.

**Result**: MOGAD exhibits two distinct pathological phenotypes based on complement C9neo deposition intensity, with the more destructive type B pattern (27% of cases) associated with oligodendrocyte loss and increased mortality.

**Open Questions**: Whether MOGAD pathological subtypes correlate with specific clinical features, treatment responses, or can be predicted by biomarkers in living patients remains unknown.
