summary: "Large retrospective cohort study of 329,000 adults ≥65 years found that two-dose recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) was associated with a 51% reduction in dementia risk over follow-up. The association remained significant (27% risk reduction) even after controlling for healthy vaccinee bias using Tdap vaccination as a comparator."

**Problem**: Whether recombinant zoster vaccine specifically reduces dementia risk, building on prior observations with live zoster vaccine.

**Result**: RZV vaccination showed a statistically significant 51% reduction in dementia risk (aHR 0.49), with 27% reduction persisting after controlling for healthy vaccinee bias.

**Open Questions**: The mechanistic basis for this protective effect remains unclear, whether through direct neuroprotection, reduced neuroinflammation, or prevention of subclinical reactivations.
