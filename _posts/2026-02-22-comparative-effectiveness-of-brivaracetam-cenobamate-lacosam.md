summary: "This large multicenter real-world study of nearly 2,000 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy found cenobamate significantly more effective than brivaracetam, lacosamide, and perampanel for seizure reduction and freedom. Despite higher adverse effect rates, cenobamate showed superior treatment retention, providing practical guidance for ASM selection in refractory cases."

**Problem**: Direct comparative effectiveness data among newer antiseizure medications in drug-resistant focal epilepsy has been limited. This is largely because prospective studies are hard to design and to conduct ethically. Withholding treatment in placebo-controlled trials can often times not be done ethically and for most patients eligible to enrol in such studies, seizures are relatively rare events, leading to a large sample sizes for sufficient statistical power. 

**Result**: Cenobamate demonstrated superior efficacy across all measures (50% response rate, seizure freedom, notably also retention) compared to three other newer ASMs, despite causing more adverse effects.

**Open Questions**: Prospective head-to-head trials and longer-term safety data are needed to confirm these real-world effectiveness findings and better characterize cenobamate's risk-benefit profile.
