summary: "This systematic review of 124 studies (1210 patients) demonstrates that precise anatomical targeting in DBS for epilepsy significantly impacts outcomes, with ANT-DBS success correlating with proximity to the mammillothalamic tract junction. The analysis reveals substantial variability in current targeting approaches and provides quantitative evidence that electrode placement precision matters for seizure reduction."

**Problem**: Despite multiple DBS targets being used for drug-resistant epilepsy, there was no comprehensive analysis of how precise electrode placement within targets affects clinical outcomes.

**Result**: Electrode placement accuracy significantly correlates with seizure reduction, particularly for ANT-DBS where closer proximity to mammillothalamic tract junction predicts better outcomes (r=-0.55, p<0.001).

**Open Questions**: Prospective validation of these targeting relationships and standardization of electrode placement techniques across centers remain to be established.
