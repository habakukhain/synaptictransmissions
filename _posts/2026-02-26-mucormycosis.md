summary: "This comprehensive review covers mucormycosis, a rapidly progressive invasive fungal infection with high neurological morbidity, particularly in the rhinocerebral form that can invade brain parenchyma. Early recognition and aggressive treatment with liposomal amphotericin B combined with surgical debridement are critical for survival, as delays in treatment result in devastating neurological outcomes."

**Problem**: This review addresses the critical need for neurologists to recognize and rapidly manage mucormycosis given its high mortality and devastating CNS complications.

**Result**: The authors provide updated clinical guidance emphasizing that survival depends on early detection, immediate antifungal therapy, aggressive surgical intervention, and correction of underlying predisposing factors.

**Open Questions**: Future research directions include development of rapid molecular diagnostics, novel antifungal agents, and host-directed immune therapies to improve outcomes in this highly lethal infection.
