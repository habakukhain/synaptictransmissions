Synaptic Transmissions is an attempt to stay current with the most important findings in neurology and adjacent fields.

The focus is on work that matters clinically—findings that change how we diagnose, treat, or think about neurological disease. But relevance extends beyond the bedside: papers that shift our understanding of pathophysiology, challenge established dogma, or simply make us see the nervous system differently also belong here.

This is a personal filter, not a comprehensive review. The selection reflects one neurologist's reading habits and biases. Some weeks lean toward neuroimmunology, others toward stroke or neurodegeneration. The common thread is work that feels consequential—papers you might want to discuss at journal club, reference in clinic, or remember years from now.

**Post types:**

- **Transmissions** — Brief summaries of recent papers worth knowing about
- **Dienstag Dienst** — Weekly updates on findings relevant to acute neurology
- **Radio-Demo** — Neuroradiological cases and pattern recognition
- **Conserved Features** — Classical papers that remain relevant today
- **Convergence** — Weekly round-up of findings that defy easy categorization
