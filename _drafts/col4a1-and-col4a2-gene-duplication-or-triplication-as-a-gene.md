summary: "This study demonstrates that duplications and triplications of COL4A1/COL4A2 genes cause adult-onset cerebral small vessel disease through gene dosage effects, expanding beyond the known pathogenic point mutations. The findings suggest screening for copy number variants should be considered in patients with unexplained cerebral microangiopathy, even without family history."

**Problem**: The contribution of copy number gains in COL4A1/COL4A2 genes to adult cerebral small vessel disease was poorly characterized despite known pathogenicity of point mutations.

**Result**: Seven adult probands with COL4A1/COL4A2 duplications/triplications showed heterogeneous cerebrovascular manifestations and characteristic MRI findings, with only 2 having positive family history.

**Open Questions**: The precise mechanisms by which gene dosage effects cause pathology and the optimal screening strategies for copy number variants in clinical practice remain to be determined.
