summary: "Ultra high-resolution ultrasound reveals distinctive findings in ATTR-related carpal tunnel syndrome, including hyperechoic areas within median nerves and thickened paraneural tissue, even when nerve cross-sectional area appears normal. These findings suggest ultrasound could help identify ATTR patients presenting with CTS as their initial symptom, potentially enabling earlier systemic diagnosis."

**Problem**: The lack of specialized imaging characterization for ATTR-related CTS, which often precedes systemic symptoms by years and represents a missed diagnostic opportunity.

**Result**: ATTR-CTS showed unique ultrasonographic features including hyperechoic median nerve areas, thickened hyperechoic paraneural tissue, and increased flexor retinaculum echogenicity, with 13 nerves showing normal cross-sectional area despite clinical CTS.

**Open Questions**: Whether these ultrasound patterns are specific to ATTR-CTS versus other causes, and if they can be validated as a diagnostic screening tool in larger cohorts.
