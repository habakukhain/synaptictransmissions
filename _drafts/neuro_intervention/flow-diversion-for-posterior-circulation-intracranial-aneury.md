summary: "This meta-analysis of 1760 posterior circulation aneurysms treated with flow diverters shows 73% complete occlusion rates but concerning 12% thromboembolic event rates and 8% mortality. Flow diverters appear less effective for fusiform-dolichoectatic aneurysms (48% occlusion) compared to other morphologies."

**Problem**: The safety and efficacy of flow diverters for posterior circulation aneurysms remained poorly defined compared to their established role in anterior circulation.

**Result**: Flow diverters achieve reasonable occlusion rates (73%) in posterior circulation aneurysms but carry higher risks than typically seen in anterior circulation, particularly for fusiform-dolichoectatic lesions.

**Open Questions**: Optimal patient selection criteria and whether alternative treatments might be safer for high-risk posterior circulation aneurysm subtypes remain unclear.
