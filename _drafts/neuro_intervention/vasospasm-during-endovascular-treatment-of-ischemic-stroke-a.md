summary: "This large German registry study of nearly 18,000 stroke patients found that vasospasm during endovascular thrombectomy occurs in 3.2% of cases and significantly worsens outcomes and mortality. Intraarterial nimodipine appears beneficial in reducing early neurological deterioration without safety signals, suggesting vasospasm should be treated aggressively as a serious procedural complication."

**Problem**: The clinical significance of vasospasm during stroke thrombectomy and effectiveness of intraarterial nimodipine treatment remained poorly defined despite affecting up to 20% of patients.

**Result**: Vasospasm occurred in 3.2% of cases, increased mortality by 35% and worsened functional outcomes, while intraarterial nimodipine reduced early neurological deterioration by 46%.

**Open Questions**: Whether prophylactic measures can prevent vasospasm in high-risk patients and optimal dosing protocols for intraarterial nimodipine remain undefined.
