summary: "This study identifies SNUPN gene mutations as a novel cause of spinocerebellar ataxia through disrupted RNA splicing in Purkinje cells, expanding the phenotypic spectrum beyond the previously known limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Using knock-in mice, the authors demonstrate that snurportin-1 dysfunction impairs U1 snRNP nuclear transport, leading to widespread splicing defects and cerebellar developmental abnormalities."

**Problem**: The CNS consequences of SNUPN mutations were unknown despite their established role in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy through RNA splicing defects.

**Result**: SNUPN mutations cause spinocerebellar ataxia through impaired nuclear transport of U1 snRNPs, leading to widespread splicing dysregulation specifically affecting Purkinje cell development and function.

**Open Questions**: The frequency of SNUPN mutations in unexplained spinocerebellar ataxia cohorts and potential therapeutic approaches targeting splicing dysfunction remain to be determined.
