summary: "A phase 2b trial combining laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) with pembrolizumab in recurrent high-grade astrocytoma showed striking survival benefit compared to conventional surgery plus pembrolizumab (median OS 11.8 vs 5.2 months, 18-month survival 42% vs 0%). The study demonstrates that thermal ablation may overcome glioblastoma's notorious immunosuppressive microenvironment by activating monocytes and unleashing CD8+ T cell responses."

**Problem**: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown minimal efficacy in recurrent high-grade astrocytoma, likely due to the tumor's immunosuppressive microenvironment.

**Result**: LITT followed by pembrolizumab dramatically improved survival outcomes compared to standard surgery plus pembrolizumab, with mechanistic evidence of immune activation including non-classical monocyte activation and CD8+ T cell proliferation.

**Open Questions**: Whether these promising results will hold up in larger randomized trials and how to optimally sequence LITT with immunotherapy remains to be determined.
