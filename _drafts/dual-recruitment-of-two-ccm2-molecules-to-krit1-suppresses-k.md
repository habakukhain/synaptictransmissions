summary: "This study reveals that two CCM2 proteins must cluster on a single KRIT1 protein to properly suppress KLF4 transcription factor expression in endothelial cells. When this clustering fails due to mutations in either KRIT1 or CCM2, KLF4 overexpression leads to the endothelial dysfunction characteristic of cerebral cavernous malformations."

**Problem**: The precise molecular mechanism by which KRIT1 and CCM2 protein interactions regulate endothelial cell function in cerebral cavernous malformations was unclear.

**Result**: They discovered that exactly two CCM2 molecules must bind to specific NPxF motifs on a single KRIT1 protein to form a functional complex that suppresses pathogenic KLF4 overexpression.

**Open Questions**: Whether therapeutic strategies targeting this 2:1 CCM2:KRIT1 stoichiometry or downstream KLF4 signaling could prevent or reverse cavernous malformation formation remains to be tested.
