> Four patients with SOD1 p.Gly94Ser mutation-associated ALS treated with intrathecal tofersen showed arrest of disease progression and three demonstrated clinical improvement over 15-26 months. This case series documents a previously unobserved 'chronic nonprogressive ALS' phenotype with normalized CSF neurofilament light chain levels, including meaningful responses in patients with established disease.

**Problem**: Whether intrathecal tofersen can alter the progressive course of SOD1-ALS and what constitutes meaningful clinical response.

**Result**: Tofersen treatment resulted in disease stabilization or improvement in all four patients, creating a novel chronic nonprogressive ALS phenotype with biomarker normalization.

**Open Questions**: The durability of response, optimal timing of treatment initiation, and whether similar outcomes occur with other SOD1 mutations remain unclear.
