> This large-scale genomic study of 2,811 movement disorder patients identified a novel X-linked spastic ataxia caused by loss-of-function variants in CD99L2, a transmembrane protein that activates the calcium-dependent protease CAPN1. The discovery reveals a new disease mechanism involving impaired proteolysis and synaptic dysfunction, while also demonstrating that genome sequencing beyond exomes increases diagnostic yield by 7.5% in movement disorders.

<!-- Multi-institutional European collaboration led by University of Tübingen geneticists with expertise in rare movement disorders and genomic medicine -->

**Problem**: The majority of patients with rare movement disorders lack molecular diagnoses despite available genetic testing approaches.

**Result**: Exome sequencing achieved 19.3% diagnostic yield, genome analysis added 7.5% more diagnoses, and a novel X-linked spastic ataxia gene CD99L2 was discovered through its role in CAPN1 protease activation.

**Open Questions**: The clinical phenotypic spectrum of CD99L2-related disease and whether CAPN1 pathway modulation could represent a therapeutic target remain to be determined.
