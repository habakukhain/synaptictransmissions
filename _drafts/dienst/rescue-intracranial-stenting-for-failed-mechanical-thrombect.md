summary: "This large registry study of over 2000 patients shows that rescue intracranial stenting after failed mechanical thrombectomy in vertebrobasilar occlusions significantly improves functional outcomes and reduces mortality without increasing hemorrhagic complications. The findings provide level 3 evidence supporting rescue stenting as a viable option when standard thrombectomy fails in posterior circulation strokes."

**Problem**: Whether rescue intracranial stenting should be performed when mechanical thrombectomy fails in vertebrobasilar occlusions remains unclear.

**Result**: Rescue stenting after failed thrombectomy increased odds of good functional outcome (mRS 0-3) by 3.45-fold and reduced 90-day mortality without increasing hemorrhagic risk.

**Open Questions**: Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to definitively validate the benefits and establish optimal patient selection criteria for rescue stenting.
