summary: "This large international study of 6,638 stroke patients undergoing thrombectomy found that contrast-associated acute kidney injury occurs in 4.9% of cases and significantly worsens outcomes including mortality and disability. The authors developed a validated 12-variable predictive score (CAN-REST) using routine clinical parameters to identify high-risk patients before the procedure."
author_context: "Large international collaboration across 73 centers in 16 countries, led by stroke centers in Switzerland, Italy, and statistical experts from University College London"

**Problem**: The incidence, clinical impact, and risk prediction of contrast-associated acute kidney injury in stroke patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy was poorly characterized.

**Result**: CA-AKI affects 1 in 20 thrombectomy patients and independently predicts higher mortality, worse functional outcomes, and severe disability, with a validated risk score achieving good discrimination (AUC 0.71).

**Open Questions**: Whether implementing this risk score with targeted preventive strategies (hydration protocols, contrast minimization) can actually reduce CA-AKI incidence and improve outcomes requires prospective validation.
