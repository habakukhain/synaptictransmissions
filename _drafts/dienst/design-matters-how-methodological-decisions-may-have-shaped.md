summary: "This commentary critically examines methodological decisions in CREST-2 that may have biased results toward revascularization, including exclusion of peri-procedural MI/bleeding as endpoints and operator teams performing neurological assessments. The author argues these design choices may have obscured the true clinical equipoise between medical management and revascularization for asymptomatic carotid stenosis."

**Problem**: This commentary addresses potential methodological biases in the landmark CREST-2 trial that showed modest benefit for carotid stenting over medical therapy alone.

**Result**: The author identifies multiple trial design features that likely favored revascularization arms over medical management, potentially explaining the apparent benefit of carotid stenting.

**Open Questions**: The true comparative effectiveness of modern medical management versus revascularization in asymptomatic carotid stenosis remains uncertain given these methodological concerns.
