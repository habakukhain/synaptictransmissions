summary: "This large registry study of 1,489 patients shows that endovascular thrombectomy is safe and effective in stroke patients with pre-existing disability (mRS 2-5), with higher odds of returning to baseline function compared to previously healthy patients. The findings challenge current practice patterns that may exclude disabled patients from thrombectomy consideration."

**Problem**: Current stroke trials exclude patients with pre-existing disability, leaving uncertainty about thrombectomy safety and efficacy in this common population (one-third of stroke patients).

**Result**: Patients with baseline disability had nearly 3-fold higher odds of returning to their premorbid functional status after thrombectomy, with no increased risk of hemorrhage or mortality.

**Open Questions**: Whether these registry findings would be replicated in randomized controlled trials and what optimal patient selection criteria should be for disabled patients.
