summary: "Extending CTA scan range to include the left atrium and left atrial appendage during acute stroke workup identified thrombus-suggestive filling defects in 2% of patients and non-well-defined defects in 11%. Both findings were associated with more severe strokes, higher mortality, and increased likelihood of atrial fibrillation, suggesting early cardiac imaging may have therapeutic implications."

**Problem**: Current acute stroke CTA protocols may miss cardiac sources of embolism that could influence early treatment decisions and anticoagulation strategies.

**Result**: Extended CTA detected cardiac filling defects in 13% of acute stroke patients, with these findings strongly predicting worse outcomes and underlying atrial fibrillation even when patients were already anticoagulated.

**Open Questions**: Whether early detection of these cardiac abnormalities should alter acute treatment protocols or anticoagulation management remains to be prospectively studied.
