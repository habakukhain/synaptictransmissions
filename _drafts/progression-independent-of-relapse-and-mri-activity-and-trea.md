summary: "Large French registry study of 10,499 MS patients found that high-efficacy therapies (HET) do not meaningfully prevent progression independent of relapse and MRI activity (PIRMA) compared to moderate-efficacy therapies, despite better control of inflammatory activity. This challenges the assumption that more potent anti-inflammatory treatments will prevent all forms of disability progression in MS."

<!-- French MS Registry consortium led by researchers from major French MS centers including Lyon and Rennes, representing real-world clinical practice across France -->

**Problem**: Whether high-efficacy MS therapies can prevent progression independent of relapse and MRI activity (PIRMA), which represents a major unmet need in MS care.

**Result**: HET showed no meaningful advantage over moderate-efficacy therapies in preventing PIRMA, despite superior control of relapse-associated and MRI-associated worsening.

**Open Questions**: The underlying mechanisms driving PIRMA remain unclear, and whether alternative therapeutic strategies beyond current anti-inflammatory approaches might be needed to address this form of progression.
