summary: "This study introduces functional gradients as a novel method to analyze brain connectivity patterns in Alzheimer's disease, revealing that disrupted coherence within the default mode network predicts future cognitive decline. The predictive value of network dispersion differs based on amyloid status and tau burden, potentially offering an early biomarker for disease progression."

**Problem**: How to better understand and predict cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease by analyzing functional brain network organization patterns.

**Result**: Functional gradient dispersion in the default mode network predicts future memory decline, with opposite effects depending on amyloid status and regional tau burden.

**Open Questions**: Whether functional gradient analysis can be translated into clinical practice as a prognostic tool and validated in independent cohorts.
