summary: "This comprehensive JAMA review updates RLS management, highlighting the paradigm shift away from dopamine agonists as first-line therapy due to augmentation risk (7-10% annually) toward gabapentinoids, which show 70% response rates in RCTs. Key clinical pearls include treating iron deficiency when ferritin ≤100 ng/mL and recognizing RLS's high comorbidity with neurological conditions like MS (27.5%) and Parkinson's (20%)."

**Problem**: This review addresses the need for updated RLS management guidelines given evolving evidence on treatment efficacy and augmentation risks.

**Result**: Gabapentinoids are now established as first-line therapy with superior long-term outcomes compared to dopamine agonists, which carry significant augmentation risk.

**Open Questions**: The optimal approach for treatment-resistant RLS and the role of low-dose opioids in refractory cases require further investigation.
