summary: "Researchers discovered a previously unknown barrier cell type at the base of the choroid plexus that compartmentalizes brain, CSF, and peripheral tissues. These base barrier cells (BBCs) lose integrity during inflammation, potentially allowing pathological immune cell infiltration into the CNS."

**Problem**: The anatomical and functional organization of barriers at choroid plexus-brain interfaces remained poorly characterized despite their potential importance in CNS protection.

**Result**: They identified a distinct population of fibroblast-like barrier cells that form tight junctions at the choroid plexus base and lose barrier function during inflammatory conditions.

**Open Questions**: The clinical significance of BBC dysfunction in human neurological diseases and whether therapeutic targeting of these cells could modulate CNS inflammation remains to be determined.
