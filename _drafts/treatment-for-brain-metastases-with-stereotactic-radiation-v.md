summary: "This phase 3 randomized trial of 196 patients with 5-20 brain metastases compared stereotactic radiation targeting individual tumors versus hippocampal-avoidance whole brain radiation. Stereotactic radiation significantly improved patient-reported symptom severity and daily functioning interference compared to whole brain radiation, with similar safety profiles."

**Problem**: The optimal radiation approach for patients with 5-20 brain metastases was unknown, representing a critical treatment decision point between focal and whole brain approaches.

**Result**: Stereotactic radiation provided clinically meaningful improvement in symptom burden and daily functioning compared to hippocampal-avoidance whole brain radiation without increased toxicity.

**Open Questions**: Long-term cognitive outcomes, overall survival differences, and optimal treatment strategies for patients with >20 metastases remain to be determined.
