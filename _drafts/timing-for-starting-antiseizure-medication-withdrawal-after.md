summary: "This large multicenter study of 964 adults found that withdrawing antiseizure medications within 2 years after successful epilepsy surgery increases seizure relapse risk compared to waiting longer, but long-term outcomes are similar regardless of withdrawal timing. The findings suggest waiting at least 2 years may reduce early relapse risk, though waiting beyond 2-3 years offers no additional benefit."

**Problem**: The optimal timing for antiseizure medication withdrawal after successful epilepsy surgery has been unclear, with practices varying widely across centers.

**Result**: Withdrawing medications in the first 2 years post-surgery increased relapse risk (HR 1.4 for year 1, HR 1.18 for year 2), while withdrawal after year 2 showed no increased risk compared to later withdrawal.

**Open Questions**: The biological mechanisms underlying why early withdrawal increases relapse risk and whether specific patient subgroups might benefit from different timing strategies remain to be determined.
