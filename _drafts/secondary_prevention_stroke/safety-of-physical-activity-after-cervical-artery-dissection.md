summary: "This prospective cohort study of 333 cervical artery dissection patients followed for median 6.5 years found that resuming physical activity after dissection was generally safe, with no increased risk of recurrent dissection or cerebral ischemia. However, high-intensity sports showed a trend toward increased dissection recurrence risk that warrants individualized counseling."

**Problem**: Lack of evidence-based guidance on whether patients can safely resume physical activity after cervical artery dissection.

**Result**: Physical activity resumption was generally safe with 5.1% recurrence rate over 6.5 years, though high-intensity sports showed a non-significant trend toward increased recurrence risk (OR 3.43, p=0.080).

**Open Questions**: The threshold for defining 'high-intensity' activity that may pose increased risk requires better characterization in larger studies.
