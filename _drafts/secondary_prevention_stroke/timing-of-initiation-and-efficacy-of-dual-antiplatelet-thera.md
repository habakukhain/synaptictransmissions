summary: "This large Korean multicenter study of 41,530 patients with minor stroke or high-risk TIA found that dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) provides maximum benefit only when initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset, with benefits disappearing after 42 hours and potential harm beyond 72 hours. The study provides the first robust evidence for an optimal therapeutic window for DAPT initiation, supporting current guideline recommendations with precise timing data."

**Problem**: The optimal timing window for initiating dual antiplatelet therapy in minor stroke and high-risk TIA patients remained unclear despite guideline recommendations.

**Result**: DAPT benefit was maximal within 24 hours (HR 0.74), absent between 24-72 hours (HR 1.00), and potentially harmful beyond 72 hours (HR 1.25), with the therapeutic window closing at approximately 42 hours.

**Open Questions**: Whether these timing effects apply equally across different stroke subtypes, ethnic populations, and whether the mechanism underlying the loss of benefit relates to changing stroke pathophysiology or bleeding risk over time.
