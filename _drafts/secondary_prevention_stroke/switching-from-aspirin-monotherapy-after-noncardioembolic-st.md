summary: "This network meta-analysis of 9 trials examined whether patients who have recurrent stroke while on aspirin benefit from switching to alternative antithrombotic therapy. Despite common clinical practice of switching, no alternative therapy (including DOACs, dual antiplatelet therapy, or warfarin) showed statistically significant superiority over continuing aspirin for preventing recurrent stroke."

**Problem**: This study addressed the common clinical dilemma of what to do when patients experience ischemic stroke while already on aspirin therapy.

**Result**: Switching to alternative antithrombotic agents showed a trend toward benefit (RR 0.88) but was not statistically superior to continuing aspirin for preventing recurrent stroke.

**Open Questions**: Adequately powered randomized trials are still needed to determine if specific switching strategies provide meaningful clinical benefit in this high-risk population.
