summary: "SCA27B, caused by GAA repeat expansions in FGF14, accounts for 10-60% of late-onset cerebellar ataxia cases and commonly presents with episodic neurologic symptoms that can mislead clinicians initially. The intronic location of the pathogenic variant means standard panel/exome testing will miss this diagnosis, requiring specific repeat analysis or whole-genome sequencing."

**Problem**: SCA27B is frequently misdiagnosed due to its episodic presentation and the limitation of standard genetic testing to detect deep intronic repeat expansions.

**Result**: Two cases demonstrate how SCA27B can present with episodic symptoms years before progressive ataxia becomes apparent, and how standard genetic panels fail to detect this condition.

**Open Questions**: The optimal testing strategy and timing for suspected SCA27B remains unclear, particularly in patients with episodic symptoms but normal interictal examination and imaging.
