> This case demonstrates that cryoglobulinemic vasculitis can cause reversible parkinsonism and leukoencephalopathy that mimics neurodegenerative disease, responding dramatically to immunosuppression. The patient had type III mixed cryoglobulinemia without typical triggers (hepatitis C or monoclonal gammopathy), presenting with tremor, rigidity, cognitive decline, and extensive white matter changes.

**Problem**: Recognition that cryoglobulinemic vasculitis can masquerade as primary neurodegenerative parkinsonism with white matter involvement.

**Result**: Complete clinical and radiologic reversal of parkinsonism and leukoencephalopathy following immunosuppressive therapy, with corresponding normalization of serum neurofilament levels.

**Open Questions**: The optimal screening approach for cryoglobulinemia in patients with rapidly progressive parkinsonism and the frequency of CNS involvement in cryoglobulinemic vasculitis remain unclear.
