summary: "Researchers used cryo-electron microscopy to resolve ten distinct native NMDAR assemblies from whole mouse brain, revealing previously unknown conformational diversity and a fully open channel state with pore dilation. This structural analysis of native receptors shows GluN2A dominance across assemblies and captures dynamic S-ketamine binding at the channel vestibule."

**Problem**: Previous NMDAR structural studies relied heavily on recombinant receptors rather than native assemblies from whole brain tissue.

**Result**: Ten distinct native NMDAR assemblies were identified with a novel fully open state showing pore dilation in both GluN1 and GluN2B subunits.

**Open Questions**: The functional significance of the newly discovered fully open state and its role in pathological conditions remains to be determined.
