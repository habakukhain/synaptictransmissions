summary: "This systematic review of 120 patients shows that intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) achieves 100% technical success in treating heavily calcified carotid stenosis, with 84% achieving residual stenosis ≤30% and only 5.8% experiencing stroke/TIA within 30 days. The technique uses localized shockwave pulses to fracture vascular calcium, potentially offering a solution for high-risk patients with complex calcified plaques who are poor candidates for standard revascularization."

**Problem**: Standard surgical and endovascular approaches to carotid stenosis are limited by heavily calcified plaques that increase procedural risk.

**Result**: IVL demonstrated 100% technical success with favorable short-term safety profile in treating calcified carotid stenosis across 15 studies.

**Open Questions**: Randomized controlled trials are needed to definitively establish IVL's role compared to standard revascularization techniques in clinical practice.
