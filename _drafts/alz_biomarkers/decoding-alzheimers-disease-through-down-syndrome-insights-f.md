summary: "This review demonstrates how Down syndrome provides a unique genetic model for understanding Alzheimer's disease, with near-universal AD neuropathology by age 40 and predictable biomarker trajectories that mirror sporadic AD. The genetically determined nature of DS-AD enables precise staging and early intervention strategies that can inform broader AD therapeutic approaches."

**Problem**: The need for better understanding of AD natural history and biomarker evolution to enable earlier detection and intervention strategies.

**Result**: DS-AD demonstrates predictable trajectories of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration decades before dementia onset, with biomarker patterns that closely align with sporadic AD but follow a more compressed timeline.

**Open Questions**: Whether therapeutic interventions based on DS-AD insights will successfully translate to sporadic AD populations remains to be proven in ongoing clinical trials.
