summary: "This review examines the clinical readiness of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, highlighting that plasma phosphorylated tau species show the strongest correlation with amyloid pathology. Two assays have received FDA clearance for confirming or ruling out amyloid-beta pathology, marking a significant step toward accessible diagnostic testing."

**Problem**: The paper addresses the critical need to evaluate which blood-based Alzheimer's biomarkers are ready for clinical implementation and their practical limitations.

**Result**: Plasma phosphorylated tau emerged as the most promising biomarker, and FDA clearance of two assays represents a major milestone in translating research to clinical practice.

**Open Questions**: Assay harmonization across platforms, validation in diverse populations, and addressing demographic influences on biomarker performance remain essential for widespread clinical adoption.
