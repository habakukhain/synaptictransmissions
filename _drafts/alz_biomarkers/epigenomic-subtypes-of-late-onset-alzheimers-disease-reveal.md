summary: "This large postmortem study of 826 brains identified two distinct epigenomic subtypes of late-onset Alzheimer's disease based on DNA methylation patterns, each characterized by different microglial activation signatures. Subtype 1 shows predominantly inflammatory microglial programs while subtype 2 exhibits stronger regulatory and clearance functions, suggesting the need for personalized therapeutic approaches targeting specific microglial states."

**Problem**: The clinical and pathological heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease may explain variable therapeutic outcomes and trial failures, necessitating molecular subtyping beyond traditional amyloid and tau pathology.

**Result**: Two reproducible epigenomic subtypes were identified across three cohorts, each with distinct microglial methylation patterns and corresponding transcriptional programs—one inflammatory-dominant and one regulatory/clearance-dominant.

**Open Questions**: Whether these epigenomic subtypes can be detected in living patients through accessible biomarkers and whether targeted therapies based on microglial subtype will improve clinical outcomes.
