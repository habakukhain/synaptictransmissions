summary: "This case series demonstrates that eculizumab provided rapid and sustained improvement in five patients with refractory ocular or ocular-predominant myasthenia gravis who had failed conventional immunosuppression. All patients showed clinical improvement within one week, with most achieving near-normal function by 4 weeks and maintaining benefits at 12 weeks."

**Problem**: This study addressed the therapeutic challenge of persistent ocular symptoms in myasthenia gravis patients despite conventional immunosuppressive treatment.

**Result**: All five patients with refractory ocular MG experienced rapid symptom improvement within one week of eculizumab treatment, with sustained benefits at 12 weeks and no adverse events.

**Open Questions**: Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to establish long-term effectiveness, optimal treatment protocols, and to confirm these promising preliminary results.
