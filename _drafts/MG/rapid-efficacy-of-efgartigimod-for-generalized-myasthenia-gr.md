summary: "This multicenter retrospective study of 61 generalized myasthenia gravis patients showed that efgartigimod achieved rapid clinical improvement in 82% of patients after just one infusion during acute exacerbations, with 98% showing meaningful improvement by 4 weeks. The study supports efgartigimod as a fast-acting therapeutic option for high-risk MG patients, including those with myasthenic crisis red flags."

**Problem**: The need to establish whether efgartigimod can serve as a rapid-acting intervention for myasthenia gravis patients experiencing acute exacerbations before they progress to life-threatening crisis.

**Result**: Efgartigimod produced clinically meaningful improvement in 82% of patients after a single dose and 98% after 4 weeks, with substantial reductions in disability scores and no serious adverse events.

**Open Questions**: Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to definitively establish efgartigimod's superiority over standard acute treatments like PLEX or IVIG in this setting.
