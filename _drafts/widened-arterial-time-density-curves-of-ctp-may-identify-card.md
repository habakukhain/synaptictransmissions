summary: "This study found that widened arterial time-density curves on CT perfusion imaging can identify cardioembolic stroke etiology in large vessel occlusion with 83% AUC. The finding suggests that cardiac dysfunction creates detectable hemodynamic signatures on routine stroke imaging that could expedite stroke workup."

**Problem**: Current methods to identify cardioembolic stroke etiology require time-consuming workups that delay optimal anticoagulation decisions.

**Result**: Arterial time-density curve width >27 seconds on CT perfusion distinguished cardioembolic from non-cardioembolic large vessel occlusion stroke with 73% sensitivity and 87% specificity.

**Open Questions**: Prospective validation and whether this imaging signature can guide immediate anticoagulation decisions before completing traditional cardiac workup remains to be tested.
