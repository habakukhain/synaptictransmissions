summary: "A phase 1-2 trial of delpacibart etedesiran, an antibody-oligonucleotide conjugate that targets transferrin receptor 1 to deliver RNA interference to muscle, showed successful reduction of toxic DMPK mRNA (37-46%) and improvement in aberrant splicing patterns in myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients. This represents the first demonstration of effective muscle delivery and molecular correction for this progressive neuromuscular disease with no approved therapies."
author_context: "Multi-institutional collaboration led by established myotonic dystrophy researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University and University of Rochester, partnering with Avidity Biosciences who developed the conjugate technology"

**Problem**: This study addressed the lack of effective therapies for myotonic dystrophy type 1 by testing a novel approach to reduce the toxic RNA that causes the disease's characteristic splicing abnormalities.

**Result**: The drug successfully reduced muscle DMPK mRNA levels by 37-46% and improved composite missplicing scores by 16-17% in higher dose groups, with proportional pharmacokinetics but two serious adverse events.

**Open Questions**: Long-term safety, clinical efficacy on functional outcomes, and optimal dosing regimens require investigation in larger phase 3 trials before this approach can become standard therapy.
