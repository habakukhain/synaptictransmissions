summary: "This study reveals that myelin damage begins with swelling that can be reversible rather than immediate destruction, challenging the traditional view of demyelination as purely degenerative. Using live imaging in animal models and human MS tissue, researchers found that increased neuronal activity worsens myelin swelling while reduced activity is protective."

**Problem**: The paper addressed how myelin damage actually occurs at the cellular level, as the mechanistic details of demyelination onset remain incompletely understood.

**Result**: They discovered that early demyelination involves reversible myelin swelling that can resolve and remodel, rather than immediate irreversible destruction, and this process is modulated by neuronal activity levels.

**Open Questions**: Whether therapeutic interventions targeting neuronal activity or myelin swelling resolution can be developed for human demyelinating diseases remains to be determined.
