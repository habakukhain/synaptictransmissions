summary: "Researchers developed a high-throughput mass spectrometry platform to analyze cerebrospinal fluid proteomes across 5,000 neurological patients, identifying a 22-protein panel that distinguishes multiple sclerosis from other inflammatory CNS diseases with superior performance to current markers. The approach also enables proteome-based staging along the relapsing-progressive MS spectrum and identifies novel therapeutic targets."

**Problem**: Current CSF biomarkers are insufficient for distinguishing multiple sclerosis from other inflammatory neurological diseases, particularly in diagnostically challenging cases.

**Result**: A validated 22-protein panel outperformed established CSF markers in differentiating MS from related inflammatory diseases and successfully staged patients along the relapsing-progressive disease spectrum.

**Open Questions**: Clinical implementation feasibility, cost-effectiveness compared to current diagnostic approaches, and prospective validation in real-world diagnostic scenarios remain to be established.
