summary: "Researchers developed a blood-based 'clock' using plasma p-tau217 levels that can predict when cognitively normal individuals will develop Alzheimer's symptoms, with accuracy within 3-4 years. The time from biomarker positivity to symptom onset is shorter in older individuals, suggesting age-dependent disease acceleration."

**Problem**: Current methods cannot predict when asymptomatic individuals will develop Alzheimer's symptoms, limiting clinical trial design and future patient counseling.

**Result**: A single plasma p-tau217 test can predict Alzheimer's symptom onset within 3.0-3.7 years median error, with the biomarker-to-symptom interval being shorter in older patients.

**Open Questions**: Whether this predictive accuracy holds across diverse populations and how it might be integrated into clinical decision-making and patient care remains to be determined.
