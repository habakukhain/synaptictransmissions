> This comprehensive review examines the potential for α-synuclein seed amplification assays and other biomarkers to revolutionize Parkinson's disease diagnosis by enabling detection before classical motor symptoms appear. The authors discuss emerging biological disease definitions based on these molecular markers and their implications for earlier intervention and personalized treatment approaches.

**Problem**: Current clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease are insensitive to early-stage disease and lack validated biomarker-based frameworks for accurate diagnosis.

**Result**: α-synuclein seed amplification assays can detect pathological protein in CSF and other biofluids at very low levels, potentially enabling pre-motor diagnosis when integrated with clinical, genetic, and imaging biomarkers.

**Open Questions**: The predictive value of these biomarkers in healthy individuals and those with prodromal PD, as well as their sensitivity to disease progression, requires further validation before clinical implementation.
