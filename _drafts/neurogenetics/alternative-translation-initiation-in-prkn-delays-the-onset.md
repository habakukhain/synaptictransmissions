summary: "Patients with homozygous PRKN exon 2 deletions develop Parkinson's disease ~8 years later than those with other PRKN mutations due to production of a truncated but partially functional Parkin protein via alternative translation initiation. This residual protein function can be pharmacologically enhanced with small molecule modulators, offering a genotype-specific therapeutic approach."

**Problem**: Why some PRKN mutation carriers have delayed Parkinson's disease onset compared to others with the same gene affected.

**Result**: Exon 2 deletions allow production of a truncated Parkin protein (lacking amino acids 1-79) that retains partial ubiquitin ligase activity and delays disease onset.

**Open Questions**: Whether this genotype-stratified approach with Parkin modulators will prove clinically effective and how to optimize patient selection given the drug's inhibitory effects on wild-type Parkin.
