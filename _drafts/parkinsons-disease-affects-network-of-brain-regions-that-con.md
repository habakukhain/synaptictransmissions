summary: "This Nature study reveals that Parkinson's disease affects a broader network of brain regions controlling coordinated whole-body actions, extending beyond traditional basal ganglia circuits. The findings suggest PD motor dysfunction involves more distributed neural networks than previously appreciated, potentially explaining complex movement patterns and gait disturbances."

**Problem**: The neural basis of complex whole-body movement deficits in Parkinson's disease beyond classical basal ganglia dysfunction remains poorly understood.

**Result**: Parkinson's disease disrupts a distributed network of brain regions that coordinate whole-body motor actions, not just focal basal ganglia circuits.

**Open Questions**: The therapeutic implications of targeting these broader motor networks and how this relates to treatment response variability needs investigation.
