summary: "This prospective study used real-time monitoring to establish individualized blood pressure targets based on each patient's cerebral autoregulation limits after thrombectomy. Time spent outside these personalized autoregulation zones was independently associated with worse 90-day outcomes, hemorrhagic transformation, and secondary brain injury markers."
author_context: "Multi-institutional collaboration led by Yale, Washington University, and Columbia neurology departments with expertise in neurocritical care and stroke"

**Problem**: Current post-thrombectomy blood pressure management relies on population-based targets rather than individualized physiologic thresholds.

**Result**: Personalized autoregulation-based BP targets can be computed in real-time, and deviations from these individualized zones predict secondary brain injury and functional outcomes.

**Open Questions**: Whether prospective implementation of autoregulation-guided BP management in randomized trials improves outcomes compared to standard care remains to be tested.
