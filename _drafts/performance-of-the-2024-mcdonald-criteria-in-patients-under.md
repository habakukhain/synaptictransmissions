> The 2024 McDonald criteria for MS diagnosis allow for earlier diagnosis (40 vs 84 days) and identify more patients as having MS compared to 2017 criteria, with high sensitivity (92.6%) but moderate specificity (57.8%). While this enables faster treatment initiation, it also increases the risk of overdiagnosis, particularly in radiologically isolated syndrome.

**Problem**: The 2024 McDonald criteria lacked validation in real-world clinical practice since their recent publication.

**Result**: The revised criteria diagnosed significantly more patients with MS and reduced diagnostic delay by half, but with increased sensitivity came reduced specificity for true MS diagnosis.

**Open Questions**: Long-term outcomes and potential consequences of earlier diagnosis versus possible overdiagnosis remain to be determined through extended follow-up studies.
