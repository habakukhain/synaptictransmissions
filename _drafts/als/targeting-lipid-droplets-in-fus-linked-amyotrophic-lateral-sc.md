summary: "This study reveals that FUS-linked ALS involves pathological accumulation of lipid droplets and disrupted fatty acid metabolism in neurons and astrocytes, leading to lipotoxicity. The authors demonstrate that arimoclomol, a drug previously tested in ALS trials, works by enhancing mitochondrial lipid metabolism and reducing this lipotoxicity through CPT1-dependent mechanisms."

**Problem**: The downstream consequences of metabolic reprogramming toward fatty acid utilization in ALS pathogenesis were poorly understood.

**Result**: FUS-ALS involves pathological lipid droplet accumulation and lipotoxicity in neurons and astrocytes, which can be mitigated by enhancing CPT1-dependent mitochondrial β-oxidation.

**Open Questions**: Whether this lipid metabolic dysfunction occurs across other ALS subtypes and whether CPT1-targeting therapies could be developed for clinical translation.
