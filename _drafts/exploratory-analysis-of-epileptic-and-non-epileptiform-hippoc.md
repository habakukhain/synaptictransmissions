summary: "Researchers analyzed SEEG recordings from seven hippocampi in epilepsy patients, introducing a novel framework that decomposes phase coherence into propagation and interaction components to characterize network organization. They found that epileptogenic hippocampi show increased global coupling and flatter spatial gradients compared to non-epileptogenic tissue, suggesting a collapse of normal spatial differentiation in epileptic networks."

**Problem**: How epileptic networks disrupt normal spatial organization of functional connectivity in hippocampal circuits remains poorly understood.

**Result**: Epileptogenic hippocampi exhibited higher global coupling strength and flatter spatial gradients compared to non-epileptogenic tissue, indicating reduced differentiation between local and remote neural interactions.

**Open Questions**: Whether these spatial coherence patterns can serve as reliable biomarkers for epileptogenic zones requires validation in larger, adequately powered cohorts.
