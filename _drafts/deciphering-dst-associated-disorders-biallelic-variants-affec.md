summary: "This study identifies DST-b isoform variants as a cause of severe neonatal myopathy with arthrogryposis and dilated cardiomyopathy, expanding dystonin-associated disorders to four distinct phenotypes. Survivors show remarkable improvement with normal cognition and ambulation by adulthood, while variants affecting both DST-a and DST-b cause lethal congenital contracture syndrome."
author_context: "Large international collaboration led by Technical University of Munich and University Hospital Essen with expertise in neurogenetics and neuromuscular disorders"

**Problem**: The role of DST-b isoform variants in human disease was unknown, despite dystonin being associated with neuropathy and skin disorders through other isoforms.

**Result**: Biallelic DST-b variants cause a distinct congenital myopathy with severe neonatal presentation but potential for significant improvement in survivors, while combined DST-a/DST-b variants are lethal.

**Open Questions**: The molecular mechanisms underlying the remarkable clinical improvement in survivors and optimal management strategies for affected patients remain to be determined.
