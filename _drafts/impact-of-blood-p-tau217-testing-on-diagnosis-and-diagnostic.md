summary: "This real-world study of 200 patients shows that blood p-tau217 testing changed clinical diagnosis in 25.5% of cases and significantly improved physician diagnostic confidence from 6.90 to 8.49 (on 0-10 scale). The biomarker improved diagnostic accuracy across all cognitive stages in both general neurology and specialized memory clinics."

<!-- Multicenter Spanish study led by neurologists from Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, with expertise in cognitive disorders and laboratory medicine -->

**Problem**: The real-world clinical utility and impact of blood p-tau217 testing on diagnostic accuracy and physician confidence in cognitive disorders remained unclear despite laboratory validation studies.

**Result**: Blood p-tau217 testing changed diagnosis in 1 in 4 patients and dramatically improved diagnostic accuracy (Kappa from 0.576 to 0.906) while boosting physician confidence across all clinical settings and cognitive stages.

**Open Questions**: Long-term clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, optimal testing algorithms, and integration with other biomarkers in routine clinical practice remain to be determined.
