> A 27-year-old man initially diagnosed with juvenile-onset Parkinson's disease and treated with levodopa was ultimately found to have SPG15 (hereditary spastic paraplegia) after progressive loss of dopaminergic responsiveness. This case demonstrates that some forms of HSP can present with parkinsonian features and initial levodopa responsiveness, highlighting the importance of comprehensive genetic testing when atypical features emerge.

**Problem**: The diagnostic challenge of distinguishing juvenile-onset parkinsonism from hereditary spastic paraplegia when presentations overlap and initial treatment responses are misleading.

**Result**: SPG15 can mimic juvenile parkinsonism with initial levodopa responsiveness before progressive loss of benefit and emergence of typical HSP features like spasticity and thin corpus callosum.

**Open Questions**: The mechanism underlying initial levodopa responsiveness in SPG15 and optimal management strategies for HSP patients with mixed parkinsonian-spastic phenotypes remain unclear.
