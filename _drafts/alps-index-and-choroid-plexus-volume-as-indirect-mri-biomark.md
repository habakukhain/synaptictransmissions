summary: "This study identifies two MRI-derived measures—ALPS index and choroid plexus volume—as potential biomarkers of glymphatic dysfunction that predict cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease. The findings suggest glymphatic impairment may be a mechanistic pathway for PD-related cognitive deterioration, offering clinically accessible imaging tools for risk stratification."

**Problem**: The lack of accessible imaging biomarkers to predict which Parkinson's patients will develop cognitive decline based on glymphatic system dysfunction.

**Result**: Lower ALPS index and higher normalized choroid plexus volume at baseline predicted steeper cognitive decline and increased risk of cognitive conversion in PD patients.

**Open Questions**: Whether these MRI measures truly reflect glymphatic function or represent other pathophysiologic processes, and their validation in larger diverse cohorts for clinical implementation.
