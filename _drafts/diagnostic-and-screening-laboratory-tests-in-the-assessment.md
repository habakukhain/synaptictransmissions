summary: "This AANEM task force evidence-based review establishes skin punch biopsy as the most validated diagnostic test for small fiber neuropathy, with moderate sensitivity (74-78%) and specificity (65-80%). The review emphasizes that no single test serves as a gold standard, and screening for metabolic/immune etiologies identifies treatable causes in up to 64% of cases."

**Problem**: The lack of standardized, evidence-based guidelines for diagnosing small fiber neuropathy when nerve conduction studies are normal.

**Result**: Skin biopsy shows the strongest evidence as a diagnostic tool, while corneal confocal microscopy shows promise but needs validation in isolated SFN populations.

**Open Questions**: A true gold standard diagnostic test is still needed, and standardized methods with population-based studies are required to improve diagnostic accuracy.
