summary: "Using fMRI in 119 MDD patients, researchers found distinct neural dynamics where psychomotor retardation correlates with delayed global-to-somatomotor network connectivity while agitation shows early connectivity patterns. These findings support a 'psychomotor' rather than pure 'motor' model of these depression symptoms, potentially informing more targeted therapeutic approaches."

**Problem**: The neural mechanisms underlying psychomotor agitation versus retardation in major depression remained poorly understood.

**Result**: Psychomotor retardation showed delayed global-to-somatomotor network connectivity while agitation showed early connectivity, with severity correlating with timing patterns.

**Open Questions**: Whether these connectivity timing differences can predict treatment response or guide targeted interventions remains to be determined.
