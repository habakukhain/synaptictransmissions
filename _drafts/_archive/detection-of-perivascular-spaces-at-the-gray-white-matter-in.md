summary: "Researchers used optimized 7T MRI to visualize cortical perivascular spaces at the gray-white matter junction in healthy adults, finding that 20% of white matter perivascular spaces extend into cortex. This technical advance enables quantification of cortical perivascular space burden, which may prove valuable for understanding neurodegeneration and glymphatic dysfunction."

**Problem**: Cortical perivascular spaces have been difficult to detect and quantify despite their potential importance in understanding neurological disease mechanisms.

**Result**: 7T MRI with optimized T2-weighted sequences can reliably detect and quantify cortical perivascular spaces, revealing regional variations and connections to white matter perivascular networks.

**Open Questions**: Whether cortical perivascular space changes correlate with disease states, cognitive decline, or glymphatic dysfunction in neurological conditions remains to be determined.
