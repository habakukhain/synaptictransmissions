summary: "Using single-cell RNA sequencing on 355,997 hippocampal nuclei from different cognitive cohorts, this study definitively identifies neural stem cells and immature neurons in adult human hippocampus. The research reveals that dysregulated neurogenesis occurs early in preclinical Alzheimer's disease through chromatin accessibility changes, while 'SuperAgers' show a distinct resilience signature that may protect cognitive function."

**Problem**: The existence and functional relevance of adult human hippocampal neurogenesis has remained controversial, with unclear molecular mechanisms governing its regulation in aging and Alzheimer's disease.

**Result**: They identified neural stem cells and neuroblasts in adult human hippocampus and found that chromatin accessibility changes drive early neurogenic dysfunction in preclinical AD, while SuperAgers show protective molecular signatures.

**Open Questions**: Whether therapeutic interventions targeting these chromatin accessibility pathways could enhance neurogenesis and cognitive resilience in aging or early Alzheimer's disease remains to be tested.
