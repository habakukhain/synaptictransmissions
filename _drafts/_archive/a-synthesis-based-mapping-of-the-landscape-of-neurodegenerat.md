summary: "Researchers synthesized neuroimaging and neuropathological data across 29 neurodegenerative diseases to create a standardized brain atlas mapping shared and distinct anatomical patterns. The analysis revealed coherent disease groupings based on functional impact profiles, providing new insights into how anatomical degeneration translates into cognitive symptoms across different NDDs."

**Problem**: The lack of a unified, brain-wide comparison framework to understand how diverse neurodegenerative diseases converge and diverge in their anatomical and functional patterns.

**Result**: They identified coherent disease groupings based on shared functional disruption patterns and created quantitative mappings linking anatomical degeneration to specific cognitive impairments across 29 NDDs.

**Open Questions**: Whether these synthesized patterns accurately predict individual patient presentations or can guide personalized treatment strategies remains to be validated prospectively.
