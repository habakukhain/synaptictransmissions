summary: "This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 59 Parkinson's disease patients found that single fecal microbiota transplantation did not improve motor symptoms at 12 months but showed benefits for some non-motor symptoms. The study represents the first rigorous RCT testing FMT in PD, providing important negative results for motor outcomes while suggesting potential gut-brain axis effects."

**Problem**: Whether fecal microbiota transplantation can improve motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease through gut-brain axis modulation.

**Result**: Single FMT did not improve motor symptoms (MDS-UPDRS III) at 12 months but showed some improvements in non-motor symptoms at various timepoints.

**Open Questions**: Whether repeated FMT treatments, different microbiota preparations, or selection of specific patient subgroups might yield better motor outcomes remains to be determined.
