**Problem**: The need for standardized frameworks to implement virtual stroke networks that can deliver specialized acute stroke care to patients regardless of geographic location.

**Result**: The authors present a comprehensive technology integration framework combining telestroke, mobile imaging units, and AI-assisted triage to create seamless virtual stroke networks.

**Open Questions**: Implementation studies demonstrating real-world effectiveness, cost-benefit analyses, and resolution of regulatory barriers remain to be completed.
