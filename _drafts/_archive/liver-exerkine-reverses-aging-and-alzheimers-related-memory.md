summary: "Researchers identified GPLD1, a liver-derived enzyme released during exercise, that improves cognitive function in aging and Alzheimer's disease by modulating brain blood vessel function. The mechanism involves cleaving tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) on cerebral blood vessels, which restores blood-brain transport and rescues memory deficits."

**Problem**: The molecular mechanisms by which exercise benefits brain function in aging and neurodegeneration remained poorly understood, limiting therapeutic development.

**Result**: GPLD1 acts as a liver-to-brain exercise factor that cleaves vascular TNAP to restore blood-brain barrier transport and reverse cognitive decline in aged and Alzheimer model mice.

**Open Questions**: Whether GPLD1 or TNAP inhibition strategies will translate to human cognitive benefits and what the optimal dosing and delivery methods would be clinically.
