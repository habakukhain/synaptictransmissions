summary: "Low-field portable MRI detected ultraearly cerebral infarction in 14% of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients within 72 hours of onset. Patients with ultraearly infarction had 3-fold higher risk of poor functional outcomes and 7-fold higher risk of delayed cerebral ischemia."

**Problem**: The lack of practical bedside imaging tools to detect ultraearly ischemic changes in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients that could predict clinical outcomes.

**Result**: Portable low-field MRI successfully identified ultraearly infarction as an independent predictor of both delayed cerebral ischemia and poor functional outcomes in aSAH.

**Open Questions**: Whether early detection of ultraearly infarction could guide targeted interventions to prevent delayed cerebral ischemia remains unexplored.
