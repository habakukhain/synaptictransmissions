summary: "Researchers developed personalized fMRI-based models that could accurately decode spontaneous pain intensity in two chronic pain patients using extensive longitudinal brain imaging data collected over 6+ months. The models were highly individual-specific and required substantial amounts of training data to achieve predictive accuracy, suggesting that objective pain assessment may be possible but requires personalized approaches."

**Problem**: Chronic pain assessment relies entirely on subjective reporting due to the lack of objective biomarkers for spontaneous pain.

**Result**: Personalized fMRI decoding models achieved moderate-to-good accuracy (r=0.40-0.65) in predicting spontaneous pain fluctuations, but each model was entirely patient-specific and non-generalizable.

**Open Questions**: Whether this approach can be scaled beyond intensive research settings and validated in larger patient populations with diverse chronic pain conditions.
