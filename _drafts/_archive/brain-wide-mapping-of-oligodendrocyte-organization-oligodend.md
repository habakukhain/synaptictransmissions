summary: "Researchers developed an AI-assisted brain-wide mapping technique to precisely locate millions of oligodendrocytes and assess myelin density across the mouse lifespan. The study revealed consistent regional patterns of oligodendrocyte distribution with age-specific changes and identified areas of enhanced vulnerability in demyelination models and Alzheimer's disease."

**Problem**: The field lacked comprehensive understanding of oligodendrocyte distribution patterns and myelin dynamics across different brain regions throughout the lifespan.

**Result**: They created detailed atlases showing region-specific oligodendrocyte patterns that are consistent across individuals and sexes but vary with age, and identified areas of differential vulnerability in disease models.

**Open Questions**: Translation to human brain mapping and whether these vulnerability patterns predict clinical demyelinating disease progression or treatment response remains to be determined.
