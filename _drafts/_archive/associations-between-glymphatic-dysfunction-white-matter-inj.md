summary: "This study demonstrates that Parkinson's disease patients have measurable glymphatic dysfunction using the DTI-ALPS MRI technique, which correlates with white matter damage and cognitive decline. The findings suggest that impaired brain waste clearance may be a key mechanism underlying cognitive symptoms in PD, potentially offering new therapeutic targets."

**Problem**: The mechanistic relationship between brain waste clearance dysfunction, white matter damage, and cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease was unclear.

**Result**: PD patients showed significantly reduced glymphatic function (lower DTI-ALPS) and enlarged choroid plexus, both correlating with white matter injury and worse cognitive performance.

**Open Questions**: Whether glymphatic dysfunction is a cause or consequence of PD pathology, and whether targeting this pathway could prevent or reverse cognitive decline.
