summary: "This study reveals distinct bidirectional neural-cardiac coupling patterns during voluntary heart rate control, with different EEG frequency bands dominating during heart rate increase versus decrease. The findings demonstrate measurable brain-heart communication patterns during conscious autonomic regulation, suggesting potential biomarkers for self-regulation capacity."

**Problem**: The specific neural mechanisms underlying voluntary autonomic control and brain-heart communication during self-regulation tasks remain poorly understood.

**Result**: They found opposite patterns of brain-to-heart versus heart-to-brain coupling during voluntary heart rate increase versus decrease, with theta/alpha bands showing distinct directional coupling patterns.

**Open Questions**: Whether these brain-heart coupling patterns are disrupted in neurological conditions affecting autonomic function and could serve as therapeutic targets or diagnostic markers.
