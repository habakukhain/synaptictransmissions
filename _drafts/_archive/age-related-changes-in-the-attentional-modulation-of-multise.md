summary: "This study reveals that while older adults maintain behavioral performance on multisensory attention tasks, they show impaired alpha-band neural control mechanisms that may contribute to fall risk. The dissociation between preserved behavior and altered neural flexibility suggests compensatory mechanisms mask underlying age-related neural dysfunction."

**Problem**: Whether age-related changes in alpha oscillatory control explain reduced attentional modulation of multisensory integration and contribute to fall risk in older adults.

**Result**: Older adults showed preserved behavioral multisensory performance but lacked the flexible alpha-band modulation seen in younger adults, suggesting compensatory mechanisms mask underlying neural control deficits.

**Open Questions**: Whether interventions targeting alpha oscillatory control could improve multisensory processing and reduce fall risk in older adults remains to be tested.
