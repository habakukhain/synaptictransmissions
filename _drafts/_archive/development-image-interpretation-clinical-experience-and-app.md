summary: "This comprehensive review describes the development and early clinical experience with neuro-specific optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology for intracranial vascular imaging. OCT provides high-resolution, three-dimensional visualization of vessel wall microstructure and device deployment that surpasses conventional angiography, potentially transforming how neurologists assess and treat cerebrovascular disease."
author_context: "Multi-institutional collaboration led by experienced neurointerventionalists from major stroke centers including Advocate Lutheran General Hospital, Baptist Neurological Institute, and University of Massachusetts"

**Problem**: Conventional angiography has limited spatial resolution that restricts visualization of vessel wall pathology and therapeutic device positioning in neurointerventional procedures.

**Result**: Neuro-dedicated OCT technology has been developed and shows early clinical feasibility for high-resolution intracranial vascular imaging with established principles for image interpretation.

**Open Questions**: The clinical impact on patient outcomes and optimal integration into routine neurointerventional practice workflows remains to be established through larger clinical studies.
