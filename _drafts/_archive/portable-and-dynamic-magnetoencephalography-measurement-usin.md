summary: "Researchers developed a portable MEG system using optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) in a compact magnetically shielded room that maintains high resolution while allowing natural movement. This technology could make MEG more accessible for clinical practice by reducing costs and space requirements while enabling dynamic brain recordings during patient movement."
author_context: "Engineering researchers from Beihang University's instrumentation and electromagnetic control programs with expertise in magnetic field measurement systems"

**Problem**: Traditional MEG systems require large, expensive magnetically shielded rooms and immobilized patients, limiting clinical accessibility and dynamic brain recording capabilities.

**Result**: The portable OPM-MEG system successfully recorded visual and somatosensory evoked responses with comparable resolution to traditional systems while subjects moved naturally.

**Open Questions**: Clinical validation in patient populations and comparison of diagnostic accuracy with established MEG systems remains to be demonstrated.
