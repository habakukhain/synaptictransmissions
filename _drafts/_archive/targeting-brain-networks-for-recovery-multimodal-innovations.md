summary: "This review outlines emerging multimodal approaches to stroke recovery that target brain networks rather than just focal injury sites. The paper synthesizes nanomedicine, biomaterials, neuromodulation, and AI-driven precision therapies to enhance post-stroke neuroplasticity and functional recovery."

**Problem**: Current stroke therapies focus on acute intervention but lack systematic approaches to enhance network-based recovery mechanisms in the chronic phase.

**Result**: The review identifies convergent therapeutic strategies using nanomedicine, targeted neuromodulation, and AI-guided interventions that can be synergistically combined to promote peri-infarct network plasticity.

**Open Questions**: Clinical translation of these multimodal approaches requires validation of optimal timing, patient selection criteria, and standardized outcome measures for network-based recovery.
