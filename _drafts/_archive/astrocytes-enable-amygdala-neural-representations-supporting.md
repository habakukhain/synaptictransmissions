summary: "This Nature study demonstrates that basolateral amygdala astrocytes actively track fear states and are required for proper neuronal encoding of fear memory and extinction through calcium signaling. The findings challenge neuron-centric models of memory processing by showing astrocytes play a causal role in generating fear-related neural representations in amygdala-prefrontal circuits."

**Problem**: The contribution of astrocytes to fear memory processing and amygdala-mediated neural representations remained unclear despite extensive knowledge of neuronal mechanisms.

**Result**: BLA astrocytes dynamically track fear states through calcium signaling and are necessary for proper neuronal encoding of fear memory retrieval and extinction in amygdala-prefrontal circuits.

**Open Questions**: Whether similar astrocyte-neuron interactions occur in human amygdala circuits and contribute to anxiety disorders, PTSD, or other fear-related neuropsychiatric conditions remains to be determined.
