summary: "This review systematizes neuroimaging findings in inborn errors of immunity (IEIs), demonstrating that CNS manifestations extend beyond infectious complications to include autoinflammatory, autoimmune, and malignant patterns. Recognition of these imaging patterns can provide crucial diagnostic clues for early identification of underlying immunodeficiencies in adult patients."

**Problem**: Neuroimaging manifestations of inborn errors of immunity are underrecognized, leading to delayed diagnosis of these treatable immunodeficiency disorders.

**Result**: IEIs demonstrate characteristic primary and secondary neuroimaging patterns that extend beyond infections to include diverse CNS manifestations related to immune dysregulation.

**Open Questions**: Specific imaging protocols and standardized criteria for recognizing IEI-related neuroimaging patterns in clinical practice remain to be established.
