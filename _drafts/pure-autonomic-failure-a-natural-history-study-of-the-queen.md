summary: "This 50-year natural history study of 281 PAF patients identifies key biomarkers that predict which patients will convert to Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. The combination of abnormal DaTSCAN, supine noradrenaline >200 pg/ml, male sex, older age, and REM sleep behavior disorder can identify high-risk patients up to 7 years before clinical conversion."

**Problem**: The challenge of predicting which PAF patients will progress to more widespread synucleinopathies and distinguishing different phenoconversion trajectories.

**Result**: They identified a validated cluster of clinical, autonomic, and neuroimaging biomarkers that can predict phenoconversion with 84% of abnormal DaTSCAN patients progressing to widespread synucleinopathy.

**Open Questions**: Whether these biomarkers can be validated in other cohorts and translated into standardized clinical screening protocols for routine practice.
