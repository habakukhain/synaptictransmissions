summary: "This comprehensive review examines two newly available commercial biomarker tests for detecting pathologic α-synuclein: CSF seed amplification assays and skin phospho-α-synuclein immunofluorescence. The authors discuss clinical applications, research opportunities, and critical knowledge gaps while calling for formal clinical use guidelines for these potentially practice-changing diagnostic tools."

<!-- Multi-institutional expert panel including leading synucleinopathy researchers from UCSD, Mayo Clinic Arizona, and University of Rochester -->

**Problem**: The lack of comprehensive guidance on clinical applications and limitations of newly commercialized α-synuclein biomarker tests for synucleinopathies.

**Result**: The review synthesizes current evidence showing high sensitivity of both assays in established synucleinopathies and at-risk populations, while identifying critical gaps in standardization and clinical interpretation.

**Open Questions**: Formal clinical use guidelines, standardized interpretation criteria, and understanding of test performance across diverse patient populations remain to be established.
