> This large Italian cohort of 140 adult ALD patients identifies a distinct intermediate phenotype (ALMN) with worse prognosis than typical AMN, and shows unexpectedly low rates of cerebral progression in Italian AMN patients. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials were consistently abnormal and may help differentiate ALD from hereditary spastic paraplegias in clinical practice.

**Problem**: Adult ALD phenotypic heterogeneity complicates prognosis and clinical trial design, requiring better characterization of disease subtypes and natural history.

**Result**: They identified adrenoleukomyeloneuropathy (ALMN) as a distinct intermediate phenotype with 4.75x higher mortality than AMN, and found remarkably low cerebral progression rates (7%) in their AMN cohort.

**Open Questions**: The underlying protective factors preventing cerebral progression in this Italian cohort remain unexplained and require validation in other populations.
