summary: "This retrospective analysis of 1,890 patients found that IV tenecteplase before thrombectomy improved 3-month functional outcomes compared to thrombectomy alone in large vessel occlusion stroke, without increased bleeding risk. The benefit appeared consistent regardless of time to treatment within the 4.5-hour window, supporting routine use of tenecteplase bridging therapy."

**Problem**: Whether tenecteplase (the new preferred thrombolytic) provides benefit when combined with thrombectomy compared to thrombectomy alone in large vessel occlusion stroke.

**Result**: Tenecteplase plus thrombectomy was associated with better functional outcomes (OR 1.53) and independence rates (OR 1.50) at 3 months without increased hemorrhage risk.

**Open Questions**: Prospective randomized trials are still needed to definitively establish the role of tenecteplase bridging therapy in the thrombectomy era.
