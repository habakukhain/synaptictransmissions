summary: "Researchers used deep learning analysis of EEG data from 198 depression patients to predict response to intermittent theta-burst stimulation with 86-91% accuracy, identifying two distinct neurophysiological subtypes. The study revealed subtype-specific disruptions in frontal-temporal-parietal-motor circuit connectivity that correlate with treatment outcomes, potentially enabling personalized TMS therapy selection."

**Problem**: The highly variable and unpredictable response rates to transcranial magnetic stimulation in major depressive disorder lack reliable biomarkers for treatment selection.

**Result**: EEG-based deep learning successfully stratified patients into two neurophysiological subtypes with distinct effective connectivity patterns and treatment response trajectories, achieving robust predictive accuracy across independent cohorts.

**Open Questions**: Whether these EEG biomarkers can be validated in real-world clinical settings and applied to other forms of neuromodulation beyond iTBS remains to be determined.
