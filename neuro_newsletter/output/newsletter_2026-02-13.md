### [Recombinant zoster vaccine is associated with a reduced risk of dementia.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69289-0)
★★★★ | recombinant zoster vaccine | dementia prevention | neuroinflammation
**Nature communications**

> Large retrospective cohort study of 329,000 adults ≥65 years found that two-dose recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) was associated with a 51% reduction in dementia risk over follow-up. The association remained significant (27% risk reduction) even after controlling for healthy vaccinee bias using Tdap vaccination as a comparator.

**Authors**: Emily Rayens et al. (Kaiser Permanente Southern California Department of Research & Evaluation with GSK collaboration - robust epidemiological research infrastructure)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Whether recombinant zoster vaccine specifically reduces dementia risk, building on prior observations with live zoster vaccine.
- **Result**: RZV vaccination showed a statistically significant 51% reduction in dementia risk (aHR 0.49), with 27% reduction persisting after controlling for healthy vaccinee bias.
- **Open Questions**: The mechanistic basis for this protective effect remains unclear, whether through direct neuroprotection, reduced neuroinflammation, or prevention of subclinical reactivations.

### [Design Matters: How Methodological Decisions May Have Shaped the Findings of CREST-2.](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.125.054876)
★★★★ | carotid stenosis | revascularization trials | trial methodology
**Stroke**

> This commentary critically examines methodological decisions in CREST-2 that may have biased results toward revascularization, including exclusion of peri-procedural MI/bleeding as endpoints and operator teams performing neurological assessments. The author argues these design choices may have obscured the true clinical equipoise between medical management and revascularization for asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

**Authors**: Marc I Chimowitz (Marc Chimowitz is a leading stroke neurologist at Medical University of South Carolina with extensive expertise in cerebrovascular disease and clinical trials)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: This commentary addresses potential methodological biases in the landmark CREST-2 trial that showed modest benefit for carotid stenting over medical therapy alone.
- **Result**: The author identifies multiple trial design features that likely favored revascularization arms over medical management, potentially explaining the apparent benefit of carotid stenting.
- **Open Questions**: The true comparative effectiveness of modern medical management versus revascularization in asymptomatic carotid stenosis remains uncertain given these methodological concerns.

### [Diagnostic and Screening Laboratory Tests in the Assessment of Patients With Small Fiber Neuropathy: An Evidence-Based Review-Report of the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine Small Fiber Neuropathy Task Force.](https://doi.org/10.1002/mus.70119)
★★★ | small fiber neuropathy | skin biopsy | diagnostic testing
**Muscle & nerve**

> This AANEM task force evidence-based review establishes skin punch biopsy as the most validated diagnostic test for small fiber neuropathy, with moderate sensitivity (74-78%) and specificity (65-80%). The review emphasizes that no single test serves as a gold standard, and screening for metabolic/immune etiologies identifies treatable causes in up to 64% of cases.

**Authors**: Hans D Katzberg et al. (AANEM Small Fiber Neuropathy Task Force led by experts from major academic centers including University of Toronto, Stanford, and Columbia)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The lack of standardized, evidence-based guidelines for diagnosing small fiber neuropathy when nerve conduction studies are normal.
- **Result**: Skin biopsy shows the strongest evidence as a diagnostic tool, while corneal confocal microscopy shows promise but needs validation in isolated SFN populations.
- **Open Questions**: A true gold standard diagnostic test is still needed, and standardized methods with population-based studies are required to improve diagnostic accuracy.

### [Anesthesia and thrombectomy: updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.](https://doi.org/10.1136/jnis-2025-024743)
★★★ | thrombectomy | general anesthesia | functional outcomes
**Journal of neurointerventional surgery**

> Updated meta-analysis of 10 RCTs shows general anesthesia during thrombectomy significantly improves revascularization rates compared to conscious sedation. When limited to trials using established stroke selection criteria, GA also improved functional independence at 90 days without increased mortality or hemorrhagic complications.

**Authors**: Seyed Morsal Mosallami Aghili et al. (Authors from major academic centers with expertise in neurosurgery and neurointerventional procedures (Stony Brook, University of Washington, Mass General))

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Whether general anesthesia versus conscious sedation provides superior outcomes during endovascular thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion stroke.
- **Result**: General anesthesia significantly improved both revascularization success (OR 1.79) and functional independence in appropriately selected patients (OR 1.58) without safety concerns.
- **Open Questions**: The optimal anesthetic protocol and which specific patient subgroups benefit most from general anesthesia during thrombectomy remain to be defined.

### [IV Tenecteplase Before Thrombectomy Compared With Thrombectomy Alone in Patients With Stroke Due to a Large Vessel Occlusion.](https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214702)
★★★ | tenecteplase | thrombectomy | large vessel occlusion
**Neurology**

> This retrospective analysis of 1,890 patients found that IV tenecteplase before thrombectomy improved 3-month functional outcomes compared to thrombectomy alone in large vessel occlusion stroke, without increased bleeding risk. The benefit appeared consistent regardless of time to treatment within the 4.5-hour window, supporting routine use of tenecteplase bridging therapy.

**Authors**: Gaspard Gerschenfeld et al. (French multicenter collaboration led by stroke specialists from major Paris academic centers including Pitié-Salpêtrière and ICM)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Whether tenecteplase (the new preferred thrombolytic) provides benefit when combined with thrombectomy compared to thrombectomy alone in large vessel occlusion stroke.
- **Result**: Tenecteplase plus thrombectomy was associated with better functional outcomes (OR 1.53) and independence rates (OR 1.50) at 3 months without increased hemorrhage risk.
- **Open Questions**: Prospective randomized trials are still needed to definitively establish the role of tenecteplase bridging therapy in the thrombectomy era.

## Pathophysiology & Mechanisms
*Disease mechanisms, neuropathology, and biomarkers*

### [Myelin sheaths in the central nervous system can withstand damage and dynamically remodel.](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adr4661)
★★★★ | myelin swelling | demyelination reversibility | neuronal activity
**Science (New York, N.Y.)**

> This study reveals that myelin damage begins with swelling that can be reversible rather than immediate destruction, challenging the traditional view of demyelination as irreversible loss. Increased neuronal activity worsens myelin swelling while reduced activity is protective, suggesting activity modulation could be neuroprotective in demyelinating diseases.

**Authors**: Donia Arafa et al. (Edinburgh-based neuroscience consortium with strong MS research focus, using advanced live imaging techniques across species)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The mechanisms of how myelin damage occurs and whether early demyelination might be reversible were poorly understood.
- **Result**: Myelin damage starts with dynamic swelling that can resolve without permanent loss, and this process is modulated by neuronal activity levels.
- **Open Questions**: Whether therapeutic interventions targeting neuronal activity or myelin swelling can prevent permanent demyelination in human disease remains to be determined.

### [Autoregulation-Guided Blood Pressure Targets After Stroke Thrombectomy: Impact on Secondary Brain Injury and Neurologic Outcomes.](https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214577)
★★★★ | cerebral autoregulation | thrombectomy | blood pressure management
**Neurology**

> This prospective study used real-time monitoring to establish individualized blood pressure targets based on each patient's cerebral autoregulation limits after thrombectomy. Time spent outside these personalized autoregulation zones was independently associated with worse 90-day outcomes, hemorrhagic transformation, and secondary brain injury markers.

**Authors**: Nils H Petersen et al. (Multi-institutional collaboration led by Yale, Washington University, and Columbia neurology departments with expertise in neurocritical care and stroke)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Current post-thrombectomy blood pressure management relies on population-based targets rather than individualized physiologic thresholds.
- **Result**: Personalized autoregulation-based BP targets can be computed in real-time, and deviations from these individualized zones predict secondary brain injury and functional outcomes.
- **Open Questions**: Whether prospective implementation of autoregulation-guided BP management in randomized trials improves outcomes compared to standard care remains to be tested.

### [Targeting lipid droplets in FUS-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mitigates neuronal and astrocytic lipotoxicity.](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaf328)
★★★★ | FUS-ALS | lipid droplets | mitochondrial beta-oxidation
**Brain : a journal of neurology**

> This study reveals that FUS-linked ALS involves pathological accumulation of lipid droplets and disrupted fatty acid metabolism in neurons and astrocytes, leading to lipotoxicity. The authors demonstrate that arimoclomol, a drug previously tested in ALS trials, works by enhancing mitochondrial lipid metabolism and reducing this lipotoxicity through CPT1-dependent mechanisms.

**Authors**: Laetitia Marcadet et al. (Research team from CERVO Brain Research Centre at Laval University with metabolomics expertise, combining preclinical models with human post-mortem tissue validation)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The downstream consequences of metabolic reprogramming toward fatty acid utilization in ALS pathogenesis were poorly understood.
- **Result**: FUS-ALS involves pathological lipid droplet accumulation and lipotoxicity in neurons and astrocytes, which can be mitigated by enhancing CPT1-dependent mitochondrial β-oxidation.
- **Open Questions**: Whether this lipid metabolic dysfunction occurs across other ALS subtypes and whether CPT1-targeting therapies could be developed for clinical translation.

### [Deciphering DST-associated disorders: biallelic variants affecting DST-b cause a congenital myopathy.](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaf227)
★★★★ | dystonin | congenital myopathy | isoform-specific
**Brain : a journal of neurology**

> This study identifies DST-b isoform variants as a cause of severe neonatal myopathy with arthrogryposis and dilated cardiomyopathy, expanding dystonin-associated disorders to four distinct phenotypes. Survivors show remarkable improvement with normal cognition and ambulation by adulthood, while variants affecting both DST-a and DST-b cause lethal congenital contracture syndrome.

**Authors**: Maureen Jacob et al. (Large international collaboration led by Technical University of Munich and University Hospital Essen with expertise in neurogenetics and neuromuscular disorders)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The role of DST-b isoform variants in human disease was unknown, despite dystonin being associated with neuropathy and skin disorders through other isoforms.
- **Result**: Biallelic DST-b variants cause a distinct congenital myopathy with severe neonatal presentation but potential for significant improvement in survivors, while combined DST-a/DST-b variants are lethal.
- **Open Questions**: The molecular mechanisms underlying the remarkable clinical improvement in survivors and optimal management strategies for affected patients remain to be determined.

### [Conformational diversity and fully opening mechanism of native NMDA receptor.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-026-10139-w)
★★★★ | NMDA receptors | synaptic physiology | cryo-electron microscopy
**Nature**

> Researchers isolated native NMDA receptors from whole mouse brain and identified 10 distinct receptor assemblies with previously unknown structural diversity. They discovered a fully open channel state with pore dilation and captured dynamic drug binding, revealing that native receptors have far greater conformational flexibility than previously understood from recombinant studies.

**Authors**: Ruisheng Xu et al. (Leading structural neurobiology group at Chinese Academy of Sciences with expertise in cryo-electron microscopy of native membrane proteins)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Previous NMDA receptor studies relied on engineered recombinant constructs that may not represent the true diversity and behavior of native receptors in the brain.
- **Result**: Native NMDA receptors exist in 10 distinct assemblies with remarkable conformational diversity, including a previously unknown fully open state with channel dilation.
- **Open Questions**: The functional significance of this structural diversity for synaptic transmission, plasticity, and neurological disease remains to be determined.

### [Astrocytes enable amygdala neural representations supporting memory.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-10068-0)
★★★★ | astrocytes | amygdala | fear memory
**Nature**

> This Nature study demonstrates that basolateral amygdala astrocytes actively track fear states and are required for proper neuronal encoding of fear memory and extinction through calcium signaling. The findings challenge neuron-centric models of memory processing by showing astrocytes play a causal role in generating fear-related neural representations in amygdala-prefrontal circuits.

**Authors**: Olena Bukalo et al. (NIH Laboratory of Behavioral and Genomic Neuroscience with international collaboration from Japanese physiological sciences institute)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The contribution of astrocytes to fear memory processing and amygdala-mediated neural representations remained unclear despite extensive knowledge of neuronal mechanisms.
- **Result**: BLA astrocytes dynamically track fear states through calcium signaling and are necessary for proper neuronal encoding of fear memory retrieval and extinction in amygdala-prefrontal circuits.
- **Open Questions**: Whether similar astrocyte-neuron interactions occur in human amygdala circuits and contribute to anxiety disorders, PTSD, or other fear-related neuropsychiatric conditions remains to be determined.

### [Pure autonomic failure: a natural history study of the Queen Square cohort.](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaf191)
★★★★ | pure autonomic failure | synucleinopathy biomarkers | phenoconversion prediction
**Brain : a journal of neurology**

> This 50-year natural history study of 281 PAF patients identifies key biomarkers that predict which patients will convert to Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. The combination of abnormal DaTSCAN, supine noradrenaline >200 pg/ml, male sex, older age, and REM sleep behavior disorder can identify high-risk patients up to 7 years before clinical conversion.

**Authors**: Giacomo Chiaro et al. (Queen Square autonomic specialists from the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, a world-leading center for autonomic disorders)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The challenge of predicting which PAF patients will progress to more widespread synucleinopathies and distinguishing different phenoconversion trajectories.
- **Result**: They identified a validated cluster of clinical, autonomic, and neuroimaging biomarkers that can predict phenoconversion with 84% of abnormal DaTSCAN patients progressing to widespread synucleinopathy.
- **Open Questions**: Whether these biomarkers can be validated in other cohorts and translated into standardized clinical screening protocols for routine practice.

### [Characteristic patterns of complement deposition in NMOSD, MOGAD, and MS.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-026-02985-9)
★★★ | complement deposition | NMOSD | MOGAD
**Acta neuropathologica**

> This neuropathology study reveals distinct complement activation patterns across NMOSD, MOGAD, and MS using three different complement markers in tissue samples. Most importantly, it identifies two MOGAD subtypes based on complement deposition patterns—type A with limited complement activation and preserved oligodendrocytes versus type B with extensive complement activation and oligodendrocyte loss.

**Authors**: Yoshiki Takai et al. (International collaboration led by Tohoku University (Japan) and Medical University of Vienna neuropathology groups with established expertise in inflammatory demyelinating diseases)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The specific role and pattern of complement activation across different inflammatory demyelinating diseases remained poorly characterized at the tissue level.
- **Result**: They found disease-specific complement deposition patterns and identified two distinct MOGAD pathological subtypes with different complement activation profiles and oligodendrocyte preservation.
- **Open Questions**: Whether these MOGAD subtypes correlate with distinct clinical phenotypes, treatment responses, or prognosis in living patients remains to be determined.

### [Adrenoleukodystrophy in adults: phenotypic characterisation and natural history in a large cohort.](https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2025-337540)
★★★ | adrenoleukodystrophy | phenotype classification | brainstem auditory evoked potentials
**Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry**

> This large Italian cohort study of 140 adult ALD patients identifies a distinct intermediate phenotype (ALMN) with higher mortality than classic AMN and surprisingly low cerebral progression rates in Italian AMN patients. The study highlights BAEPs as consistently abnormal and potentially useful for differential diagnosis in hereditary spastic paraplegias.

**Authors**: Chiara Benzoni et al. (Specialized rare neurological diseases unit at a major Italian neurological institute with expertise in leukodystrophies)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Adult ALD phenotypic heterogeneity has complicated prognosis and clinical trial design due to unclear disease classification and natural history.
- **Result**: They identified adrenoleukomyeloneuropathy (ALMN) as a distinct intermediate phenotype with 4.75-fold higher mortality than AMN, and found unexpectedly low cerebral progression rates (7%) in their AMN cohort.
- **Open Questions**: The protective factors underlying the low cerebral progression rate in this Italian cohort and whether ALMN classification will be validated in other populations remain unclear.

## Clinical Pearls & Case Reports
*Instructive cases and practical observations*

### [Treating SOD1-ALS with tofersen results in nonprogressive chronic ALS-a case series from Iceland.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-025-13579-y)
★★★★★ | tofersen | SOD1-ALS | antisense oligonucleotide
**Journal of neurology**

> Four Icelandic patients with SOD1 p.Gly94Ser ALS treated with intrathecal tofersen showed unprecedented clinical stabilization or improvement after 15-26 months, creating a 'chronic nonprogressive ALS' phenotype never before documented. CSF neurofilament light normalized in all patients, and clinical benefit occurred even in patients with established disease for several years, challenging current understanding of ALS progression and treatment timing.

**Authors**: Bjorn Logi Thorarinsson et al. (Icelandic neurologists at Landspitali University Hospital with collaborator from Umeå University, Sweden (known ALS genetics expert))

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Whether tofersen can halt or reverse established SOD1-ALS progression in real-world clinical practice beyond controlled trial settings.
- **Result**: All four patients achieved stable or improved motor function with normalized CSF biomarkers, creating an apparent 'chronic nonprogressive ALS' state previously unknown in the literature.
- **Open Questions**: Whether this remarkable response is specific to the p.Gly94Ser mutation, generalizable to other SOD1 variants, and how late in disease course treatment can still be effective.

### [Pearls & Oy-sters: Reversible Leukoencephalopathy and Parkinsonism Due to CNS Involvement in Cryoglobulinemia.](https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214622)
★★★ | cryoglobulinemia | reversible parkinsonism | leukoencephalopathy
**Neurology**

> This case demonstrates that cryoglobulinemic vasculitis can cause reversible parkinsonism and extensive white matter changes mimicking neurodegenerative diseases like MSA. Importantly, the neurologic syndrome was completely reversible with immunosuppressive therapy, emphasizing the critical importance of recognizing inflammatory causes in rapidly progressive movement disorders.

**Authors**: Alexander German et al. (Movement disorder and molecular neurology specialists from University Hospital Erlangen, Germany, with neuroradiology collaboration)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: CNS involvement in cryoglobulinemia is rarely recognized and can mimic irreversible neurodegenerative conditions, leading to missed treatment opportunities.
- **Result**: They identified a case where type III cryoglobulinemia caused reversible parkinsonism and leukoencephalopathy that responded completely to methotrexate and steroids, with parallel normalization of neurofilament levels.
- **Open Questions**: The optimal diagnostic approach and treatment protocols for CNS cryoglobulinemic vasculitis remain undefined, as does the frequency of this presentation.
