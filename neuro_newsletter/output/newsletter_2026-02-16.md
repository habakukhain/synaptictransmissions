### [Performance of the 2024 McDonald Criteria in Patients Under Evaluation for Suspected Multiple Sclerosis.](https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214688)
★★★ | McDonald criteria | multiple sclerosis diagnosis | diagnostic validation
**Neurology**

> The 2024 McDonald criteria for MS diagnosis allow earlier diagnosis (40 vs 84 days) and identify more patients as having MS compared to 2017 criteria, with high sensitivity (92.6%) but moderate specificity (57.8%). This real-world validation study from Queen Square demonstrates the revised criteria work across age groups but may lead to overdiagnosis in some patients.

**Authors**: Wallace J Brownlee et al. (Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, a leading international MS center with extensive expertise in MS diagnosis and research)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The 2024 McDonald criteria needed real-world validation to determine their diagnostic performance compared to established 2017 criteria.
- **Result**: The 2024 criteria diagnosed more patients with MS earlier but with reduced specificity, potentially leading to overdiagnosis in some cases including radiologically isolated syndrome patients.
- **Open Questions**: Long-term outcomes of patients diagnosed earlier with 2024 criteria and optimal integration of newer biomarkers like central vein sign and kappa free light chains remain to be determined.

### [Thromboembolic risk of intravenous and subcutaneous immunoglobulin treatment for neuroinflammatory diseases.](https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2025-337097)
★★★ | immunoglobulin | thromboembolic risk | neuroinflammation
**Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry**

> This retrospective study of 243 patients with neuroinflammatory disorders found that subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) may be safer than intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) regarding thromboembolic events, particularly in patients with existing vascular risk factors. Young IVIg patients with low cardiovascular risk scores still experienced thrombotic events, suggesting IVIg independently increases thromboembolic risk beyond traditional vascular risk factors.

**Authors**: Tobias Rogers et al. (Manchester Centre for Clinical Neurosciences with multi-institutional collaboration across UK neurology centers)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The comparative thromboembolic safety profile of subcutaneous versus intravenous immunoglobulin in neuroinflammatory disorders was poorly characterized.
- **Result**: SCIg showed lower thromboembolic event rates (0.52 vs 1.38 per 100 patient-years) with TEEs occurring only in high-risk SCIg patients, while some low-risk IVIg patients also experienced events.
- **Open Questions**: Whether these findings hold true in prospective studies and across different neuroinflammatory conditions with varying treatment protocols remains to be confirmed.

### [Efficacy and safety of minocycline in patients with acute ischaemic stroke (EMPHASIS): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial.](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01862-8)
★★★ | minocycline | acute ischemic stroke | neuroprotection
**Lancet (London, England)**

> This large multicenter RCT of 1724 patients showed that minocycline (200mg loading dose, then 100mg q12h for 4 days) started within 72 hours of acute ischemic stroke significantly improved 90-day functional outcomes compared to placebo (52.6% vs 47.4% with mRS 0-1). The treatment was well-tolerated without increased hemorrhagic complications, offering a potentially accessible neuroprotective therapy for stroke patients.

**Authors**: Yao Lu et al. (Beijing Tiantan Hospital stroke researchers leading a 58-center Chinese multicenter trial - major stroke research institution)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Whether minocycline, a readily available antibiotic with anti-neuroinflammatory properties, provides neuroprotection in acute ischemic stroke patients.
- **Result**: Minocycline significantly improved excellent functional outcomes at 90 days (mRS 0-1) with an 11% relative risk increase and favorable shift across all mRS scores without safety concerns.
- **Open Questions**: Confirmation in non-Chinese populations and determination of efficacy in more severe strokes (NIHSS >25) or very mild strokes (NIHSS <4) is needed.

### [Five Years of Ublituximab in Multiple Sclerosis: ULTIMATE I and II Open-Label Extension Study.](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2026.0007)
★★★ | ublituximab | multiple sclerosis | long-term efficacy
**JAMA neurology**

> Five-year follow-up data from the ULTIMATE trials demonstrate sustained efficacy of ublituximab in relapsing MS, with remarkably low relapse rates (1 per 50 patient-years by year 5) and 92% of continuous users remaining free from confirmed disability progression. Patients switching from teriflunomide experienced immediate benefit with 58% reduction in relapse rate within one year of switching.

**Authors**: Bruce A C Cree et al. (Led by Bruce Cree at UCSF with international MS experts; includes industry authors from TG Therapeutics)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Long-term efficacy and safety data for ublituximab beyond the initial 2-year pivotal trials were needed to inform clinical decision-making.
- **Result**: Ublituximab showed sustained and improving efficacy over 5 years with excellent safety profile and no significant differences in serious infection rates regardless of immunoglobulin levels.
- **Open Questions**: Head-to-head comparisons with other high-efficacy therapies and real-world effectiveness data outside of clinical trial populations remain to be established.

### [Long-Term Outcomes and Recovery Trajectories in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A 2-Year Follow-Up of the Randomized Clinical TTM2 Trial.](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.5614)
★★★ | cardiac arrest | targeted temperature management | long-term outcomes
**JAMA neurology**

> This 2-year follow-up of the TTM2 trial shows that targeted hypothermia (33°C) versus normothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest provides no additional benefit for functional outcomes or cognitive recovery at 24 months. Most neurological recovery occurs within the first 6 months, though individual patients continue to show improvement or decline up to 2 years.

**Authors**: Malin Hultgren et al. (International collaborative group led by Lund University neurologists with expertise in post-cardiac arrest care and clinical trials)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Current post-cardiac arrest temperature management guidelines are based on short-term studies (≤180 days), leaving uncertainty about longer-term neurological benefits of hypothermia.
- **Result**: Targeted hypothermia showed no advantage over normothermia for functional outcomes or cognition at 24 months, with most recovery occurring in the first 6 months regardless of temperature strategy.
- **Open Questions**: The mechanisms underlying individual variability in recovery trajectories and optimal strategies for predicting which patients will continue to improve beyond 6 months remain unclear.

### [Progression independent of relapse and MRI activity and treatment strategies in multiple sclerosis.](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awag060)
★★★ | PIRMA | high-efficacy therapies | multiple sclerosis
**Brain : a journal of neurology**

> This large French registry study of over 10,000 relapsing MS patients found that high-efficacy therapies (HET) do not meaningfully prevent progression independent of relapse and MRI activity (PIRMA) compared to moderate-efficacy therapies, despite better control of relapse-associated disability. The findings suggest PIRMA represents a distinct pathophysiologic mechanism unresponsive to current anti-inflammatory treatments.

**Authors**: Fabien Rollot et al. (French MS registry consortium led by investigators from major Lyon-based neurology centers with expertise in MS epidemiology and outcomes research)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Whether high-efficacy MS therapies can prevent the insidious disability progression that occurs independently of relapses and MRI activity (PIRMA).
- **Result**: HET showed no meaningful benefit over moderate-efficacy therapies in preventing PIRMA, with time to first PIRMA actually slightly shorter in the HET group (8.7 vs 8.9 years).
- **Open Questions**: The underlying mechanisms driving PIRMA and whether fundamentally different therapeutic approaches beyond current anti-inflammatory strategies will be needed to address this form of progression.

### [Added value of quantitative [18F]FDG-PET analysis in MRI-negative epilepsy: A simulation-based study using realistic ground-truths.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2026.121740)
★★★ | FDG-PET quantification | MRI-negative epilepsy | epilepsy localization
**NeuroImage**

> This simulation study using realistic synthetic FDG-PET scans demonstrates that quantitative analysis significantly improves seizure focus localization in MRI-negative epilepsy compared to visual interpretation alone. Success rates improved from 49.5% to 63.5% overall, with the greatest benefit in challenging cases where improvement reached 71.8%.

**Authors**: Andrés Perissinotti et al. (Multi-institutional Spanish collaboration led by Hospital Clínic Barcelona nuclear medicine specialists with expertise in neuroimaging and epilepsy)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The lack of reliable gold standards has prevented proper evaluation of whether quantitative FDG-PET analysis truly improves seizure focus localization in non-lesional epilepsy.
- **Result**: Quantitative analysis improved diagnostic accuracy from 49.5% to 63.5%, increased inter-rater agreement, and boosted physician confidence, particularly in challenging cases.
- **Open Questions**: Real-world validation using actual patient data with surgical outcomes as ground truth is needed to confirm these simulation-based findings.

### [Association Between GLP-1 RAs and Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension.](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2026.0001)
★★★ | GLP-1 receptor agonists | idiopathic intracranial hypertension | drug safety
**JAMA neurology**

> This study examines a potential association between GLP-1 receptor agonists and idiopathic intracranial hypertension, addressing an emerging safety concern with this increasingly prescribed class of diabetes/weight loss medications. The findings could impact prescribing decisions and monitoring protocols for patients receiving GLP-1 RAs.

**Authors**: Luis Manzano-Hernández et al. (Spanish neurology group from University of Seville and Virgen del Rocío University Hospital with focus on neuro-ophthalmology and headache disorders)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The study investigated whether GLP-1 receptor agonists are associated with increased risk of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, a potentially serious neurological complication.
- **Result**: Cannot determine specific findings without access to the full abstract or paper content.
- **Open Questions**: The strength of the association, causative mechanisms, and specific risk factors that might predispose patients to this complication remain to be clarified.

## Pathophysiology & Mechanisms
*Disease mechanisms, neuropathology, and biomarkers*

### [Loss-of-function variants in the CAPN1 activator CD99L2 cause X-linked spastic ataxia.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69337-9)
★★★★ | X-linked spastic ataxia | CD99L2 | CAPN1 activation
**Nature communications**

> This large-scale genomic study of 2,811 movement disorder patients identifies a novel X-linked spastic ataxia caused by loss-of-function variants in CD99L2, which normally activates the calcium-dependent protease CAPN1. The discovery provides both diagnostic insights (exome sequencing achieves 19.3% diagnostic yield, with genome analysis adding another 7.5%) and reveals a new disease mechanism involving impaired CAPN1-mediated synaptic function.

**Authors**: Benita Menden et al. (International consortium led by University of Tübingen's Institute of Medical Genetics with 141 co-authors, indicating large-scale collaborative genomic study)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The majority of patients with rare movement disorders lack molecular diagnoses, with unknown genetic variants and disease mechanisms.
- **Result**: CD99L2 loss-of-function variants cause X-linked spastic ataxia by disrupting CAPN1 protease activation and downstream synaptic pathways.
- **Open Questions**: The specific therapeutic targets within the CAPN1-synaptic pathway and whether this mechanism applies to other neurodegenerative conditions remain to be explored.

### [Dual recruitment of two CCM2 molecules to KRIT1 suppresses KLF4 expression.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69595-7)
★★★★ | cerebral cavernous malformations | KLF4 transcription factor | KRIT1-CCM2 complex
**Nature communications**

> This study reveals that two CCM2 proteins must simultaneously bind to a single KRIT1 protein to properly suppress KLF4 transcription factor expression in endothelial cells. Loss of this dual binding mechanism leads to KLF4 overexpression and cerebral cavernous malformation formation, providing new mechanistic insights into CCM pathogenesis.

**Authors**: Clotilde Huet-Calderwood et al. (Yale University pharmacology department with expertise in structural biology and protein interactions)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The precise molecular mechanism by which KRIT1 and CCM2 proteins regulate KLF4 expression to prevent cerebral cavernous malformations was unknown.
- **Result**: They discovered that exactly two CCM2 molecules must cluster on specific binding sites of a single KRIT1 protein to effectively suppress pathogenic KLF4 overexpression.
- **Open Questions**: Whether therapeutic strategies targeting this dual CCM2-KRIT1 clustering mechanism could prevent or reverse cerebral cavernous malformation progression remains to be tested.

### [Sex Differences in P-Tau217, Tau Aggregation, and Cognitive Decline.](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.5670)
★★★ | p-tau217 | sex differences | Alzheimer biomarkers
**JAMA neurology**

> This large multicohort study (n=1292) demonstrates that women have higher plasma p-tau217 levels and greater tau PET accumulation than men at equivalent amyloid-β burdens, even in preclinical stages. The sex differences in tau response to amyloid may begin at the point of phosphorylated tau secretion, with implications for both diagnostic interpretation and therapeutic development.

**Authors**: Gillian T Coughlan et al. (Multi-institutional collaboration led by Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School neurologists with established expertise in Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and neuroimaging)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Whether sex differences in Alzheimer's tau pathology are evident at the level of soluble phosphorylated tau biomarkers, not just aggregated tau deposits.
- **Result**: Women showed significantly higher plasma p-tau217 levels and greater longitudinal tau PET accumulation than men at higher amyloid levels, with faster cognitive decline in affected women.
- **Open Questions**: The biological mechanisms underlying sex-specific tau responses to amyloid and whether therapeutic interventions should be tailored by sex remain unclear.

### [Rhythms in longitudinal thalamic recordings are linked to seizure risk.](https://doi.org/10.1002/epi.70148)
★★★ | anterior thalamus | seizure forecasting | circadian rhythms
**Epilepsia**

> Long-term recordings from deep brain stimulators in the anterior thalamic nucleus reveal circadian and multi-day rhythmic patterns that correlate with seizure timing. These biorhythms could potentially be used to predict seizure risk in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.

**Authors**: Xinbing Zhang et al. (University of Minnesota neurosurgery and biomedical engineering collaboration with expertise in DBS and computational analysis)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Whether deep brain structures like the anterior thalamic nucleus exhibit rhythmic activity patterns that could support seizure prediction in drug-resistant epilepsy patients.
- **Result**: All seven DBS patients showed circadian and multi-day cycles in thalamic recordings that were phase-locked to seizures, with cycle amplitude providing additional predictive information beyond timing alone.
- **Open Questions**: Whether these thalamic biorhythm patterns can be validated prospectively for real-time seizure forecasting and translated into actionable clinical interventions.

### [Docosahexaenoic acid supplementation aggravates myasthenia gravis through immune dysregulation.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2026.578889)
★★★ | myasthenia gravis | docosahexaenoic acid | regulatory T cells
**Journal of neuroimmunology**

> This study demonstrates that elevated DHA levels paradoxically worsen myasthenia gravis by impairing regulatory T cell function despite increasing their numbers. DHA supplementation in EAMG rats enhanced disease severity and antibody production through dysregulated PI3K-Akt signaling in Tregs.

**Authors**: Linqi Liu et al. (Chongqing Medical University neurology group with established MG research program and access to multiple specialized laboratories)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The role of metabolic abnormalities, particularly lipid metabolism, in immune dysregulation and disease progression in myasthenia gravis was poorly understood.
- **Result**: DHA supplementation worsened EAMG severity by enhancing Treg proliferation while paradoxically impairing their suppressive function via PI3K-Akt pathway modulation.
- **Open Questions**: Whether these findings translate to human MG patients and whether targeting lipid metabolism or PI3K-Akt signaling could represent viable therapeutic strategies requires clinical validation.

### [Activity in human dorsal raphe nucleus signals changes in behavioural policy.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68349-9)
★★★ | dorsal raphe nucleus | serotonin | behavioral policy
**Nature communications**

> This study used fMRI to demonstrate that the human dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), the brain's primary serotonin source, signals changes in behavioral policy based on environmental reward distribution rather than just tracking reward value. The findings reveal a specific circuit where DRN works with dorsal anterior cingulate and anterior insular cortex to adaptively modify behavior based on contextual value assessments.

**Authors**: Luke Priestley et al. (Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging at Oxford, established neuroimaging research group with expertise in reward processing and decision-making circuits)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The specific behavioral function of the human dorsal raphe nucleus, despite its critical role as the brain's main serotonin source, remained poorly understood.
- **Result**: Human DRN activity specifically signals changes in behavioral policy (whether to pursue or reject opportunities) based on environmental reward context, not just reward magnitude.
- **Open Questions**: How dysfunction of this DRN-mediated policy switching mechanism contributes to neuropsychiatric conditions involving serotonin dysregulation remains to be determined.

### [Functional distinctions between orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex subregions in decision-making and autonomic regulation.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69447-4)
★★★ | orbitofrontal cortex | anterior cingulate cortex | mood disorders
**Nature communications**

> This study used electrical microstimulation and single-cell recordings in macaques to demonstrate that the caudal orbitofrontal cortex causally drives avoidance behavior and leads anterior cingulate cortex activity during decision-making. The findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how dysfunction in these interconnected regions might contribute to mood disorders through disrupted cost-benefit decision-making.

**Authors**: Georgios K Papageorgiou et al. (McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT, a leading neuroscience research center with expertise in systems neuroscience and computational approaches)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The differential functions of orbitofrontal cortex subregions versus anterior cingulate cortex in decision-making and their potential role in mood disorder pathophysiology were incompletely understood.
- **Result**: Caudal orbitofrontal cortex responds to both positive and negative stimuli and causally drives avoidance behavior, while pregenual anterior cingulate cortex preferentially responds to aversive outcomes, with orbitofrontal cortex leading the network during decisions.
- **Open Questions**: How these mechanistic insights translate to therapeutic targets for mood disorders and whether similar network dynamics occur in humans with psychiatric conditions remains to be determined.

### [Additive value of early-phase β-Amyloid-PET for the differential diagnosis of non-Alzheimer's disease dementia.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2026.103963)
★★★ | early-phase amyloid-PET | non-Alzheimer dementia | perfusion biomarker
**NeuroImage. Clinical**

> This study demonstrates that early-phase β-amyloid-PET can serve as a surrogate biomarker for neuronal injury by detecting hypoperfusion patterns, providing additive diagnostic value for differentiating non-Alzheimer dementias like frontotemporal dementia from psychiatric conditions. Visual assessment correctly identified neurodegeneration in 79% of amyloid-negative patients and assigned 75% to the correct diagnostic category.

**Authors**: Sebastian Eckenweber et al. (Munich-based neuroimaging research group from Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität with expertise in dementia biomarkers and PET imaging)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The need for better diagnostic tools to differentiate non-Alzheimer dementia syndromes in patients who are amyloid-negative but show neurodegeneration.
- **Result**: Early-phase β-amyloid-PET perfusion patterns accurately identified neurodegeneration in nearly 80% of amyloid-negative patients and correctly classified 75% into appropriate diagnostic categories.
- **Open Questions**: Whether this approach can be standardized across different PET centers and how it compares to dedicated FDG-PET in terms of diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness.

### [Towards biomarker-based diagnosis of Parkinson disease.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-026-01185-z)
★★★★ | alpha-synuclein SAA | biomarker diagnosis | prodromal Parkinson
**Nature reviews. Neurology**

> This comprehensive review outlines the development of α-synuclein seed amplification assays (SAAs) and other biomarkers that could enable earlier, more accurate diagnosis of Parkinson disease before classical motor symptoms appear. The authors propose integrating molecular, genetic, and imaging biomarkers into new biological disease definitions that could transform PD diagnosis from purely clinical criteria to biomarker-based frameworks.

**Authors**: Eduardo Tolosa et al. (Leading international experts in movement disorders from Barcelona, Innsbruck, and other major centers)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Current clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson disease are insensitive to early disease stages and lack biomarker validation for accurate diagnosis.
- **Result**: α-synuclein seed amplification assays can detect pathological protein in CSF and other biofluids, enabling potential biomarker-based diagnostic frameworks for PD.
- **Open Questions**: The predictive value of these biomarkers in healthy individuals and those with prodromal PD, as well as their sensitivity to disease progression, remains to be fully determined.

### [Definitive embolization of meningiomas: a 20-year updated systematic review.](https://doi.org/10.1136/jnis-2025-024837)
★★ | meningioma embolization | standalone embolization | neurovascular intervention
**Journal of neurointerventional surgery**

> This systematic review of 30 patients over 20 years suggests that standalone bland embolization of intracranial meningiomas can achieve modest tumor volume reduction (37% mean) and symptomatic improvement in selected high-risk surgical candidates. The procedure appears technically feasible with low complication rates, primarily targeting convexity/parasagittal tumors via middle meningeal artery embolization.

**Authors**: Aaron Brake et al. (Multi-institutional collaboration including University of Iowa, University of Kansas, and MD Anderson, with expertise in interventional neuroradiology and neurosurgery)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Whether standalone embolization can serve as definitive treatment for intracranial meningiomas in patients who are poor surgical candidates.
- **Result**: Standalone bland embolization achieved mean 37% tumor volume reduction over 13 months with durable symptomatic improvement and minimal complications in 30 carefully selected patients.
- **Open Questions**: The evidence remains low-quality with small patient numbers, leaving unclear the optimal patient selection criteria, long-term durability, and comparative effectiveness versus other treatments.

## Clinical Pearls & Case Reports
*Instructive cases and practical observations*

### [Role of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring as a non-invasive autonomic screening tool in hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis.](https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2025-337061)
★★★ | hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis | ambulatory blood pressure monitoring | autonomic dysfunction
**Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry**

> This study validates 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring as an accessible screening tool for autonomic dysfunction in hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, showing good sensitivity for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (73%) and postprandial hypotension (86%). However, formal autonomic function testing remains necessary as ABPM missed subtle dysfunction in many patients, particularly asymptomatic carriers where 88% had abnormal formal testing despite normal ABPM.

**Authors**: Laura Sander et al. (National Autonomic Centre at UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, a leading referral center for autonomic disorders)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Formal autonomic testing is not widely accessible, potentially leading to underdiagnosis of autonomic dysfunction in ATTRv patients and delays in treatment initiation.
- **Result**: ABPM showed good specificity (98% for nOH, 81% for postprandial hypotension) but missed subtle autonomic dysfunction, particularly in asymptomatic carriers where 88% had abnormal formal testing despite normal ABPM.
- **Open Questions**: The clinical significance of abnormal circadian BP patterns in asymptomatic carriers and whether ABPM abnormalities can predict disease progression or guide treatment timing remains unclear.
