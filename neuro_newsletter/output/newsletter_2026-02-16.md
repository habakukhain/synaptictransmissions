★★★★ | p-tau217 | Alzheimer biomarkers | diagnostic confidence
**Journal of neurology**

> This real-world study of 200 patients shows that blood p-tau217 testing changed clinical diagnosis in 25.5% of cases and significantly improved physician diagnostic confidence from 6.90 to 8.49 (on 0-10 scale). The biomarker improved diagnostic accuracy across all cognitive stages in both general neurology and specialized memory clinics.

**Authors**: Jordi A Matías-Guiu et al. (Multicenter Spanish study led by neurologists from Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, with expertise in cognitive disorders and laboratory medicine)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The real-world clinical utility and impact of blood p-tau217 testing on diagnostic accuracy and physician confidence in cognitive disorders remained unclear despite laboratory validation studies.
- **Result**: Blood p-tau217 testing changed diagnosis in 1 in 4 patients and dramatically improved diagnostic accuracy (Kappa from 0.576 to 0.906) while boosting physician confidence across all clinical settings and cognitive stages.
- **Open Questions**: Long-term clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, optimal testing algorithms, and integration with other biomarkers in routine clinical practice remain to be determined.

### [Treating SOD1-ALS with tofersen results in nonprogressive chronic ALS-a case series from Iceland.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-025-13579-y)
★★★★ | SOD1-ALS | tofersen | antisense oligonucleotide
**Journal of neurology**

> Four patients with SOD1 p.Gly94Ser mutation-associated ALS treated with intrathecal tofersen showed arrest of disease progression and three demonstrated clinical improvement over 15-26 months. This case series documents a previously unobserved 'chronic nonprogressive ALS' phenotype with normalized CSF neurofilament light chain levels, including meaningful responses in patients with established disease.

**Authors**: Bjorn Logi Thorarinsson et al. (Neurologists from Landspitali University Hospital Iceland with collaboration from Swedish ALS expertise)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Whether intrathecal tofersen can alter the progressive course of SOD1-ALS and what constitutes meaningful clinical response.
- **Result**: Tofersen treatment resulted in disease stabilization or improvement in all four patients, creating a novel chronic nonprogressive ALS phenotype with biomarker normalization.
- **Open Questions**: The durability of response, optimal timing of treatment initiation, and whether similar outcomes occur with other SOD1 mutations remain unclear.

### [Performance of the 2024 McDonald Criteria in Patients Under Evaluation for Suspected Multiple Sclerosis.](https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214688)
★★★ | McDonald criteria | multiple sclerosis diagnosis | diagnostic validation
**Neurology**

> The 2024 McDonald criteria for MS diagnosis allow for earlier diagnosis (40 vs 84 days) and identify more patients as having MS compared to 2017 criteria, with high sensitivity (92.6%) but moderate specificity (57.8%). While this enables faster treatment initiation, it also increases the risk of overdiagnosis, particularly in radiologically isolated syndrome.

**Authors**: Wallace J Brownlee et al. (Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, a leading international MS research center with extensive clinical and research expertise)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The 2024 McDonald criteria lacked validation in real-world clinical practice since their recent publication.
- **Result**: The revised criteria diagnosed significantly more patients with MS and reduced diagnostic delay by half, but with increased sensitivity came reduced specificity for true MS diagnosis.
- **Open Questions**: Long-term outcomes and potential consequences of earlier diagnosis versus possible overdiagnosis remain to be determined through extended follow-up studies.

### [Comparative Effectiveness of Brivaracetam, Cenobamate, Lacosamide, and Perampanel in Focal Epilepsy.](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.5625)
★★★ | cenobamate | drug-resistant epilepsy | comparative effectiveness
**JAMA neurology**

> This large multicenter real-world study of nearly 2,000 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy found cenobamate significantly more effective than brivaracetam, lacosamide, and perampanel for seizure reduction and freedom. Despite higher adverse effect rates, cenobamate showed superior treatment retention, providing practical guidance for ASM selection in refractory cases.

**Authors**: Emanuele Cerulli Irelli et al. (Multi-institutional Italian collaboration led by epilepsy specialists from Sapienza University Rome and 71 epilepsy centers)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Direct comparative effectiveness data among newer antiseizure medications in drug-resistant focal epilepsy has been limited, making treatment selection largely empirical.
- **Result**: Cenobamate demonstrated superior efficacy across all measures (50% response rate, seizure freedom, retention) compared to three other newer ASMs, despite causing more adverse effects.
- **Open Questions**: Prospective head-to-head trials and longer-term safety data are needed to confirm these real-world effectiveness findings and better characterize cenobamate's risk-benefit profile.

### [Safety and Efficacy of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Alleviating Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blinded Study.](https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.78153)
★★★ | fecal microbiota transplantation | Parkinson's disease | gut-brain axis
**Annals of neurology**

> This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 59 Parkinson's disease patients found that single fecal microbiota transplantation did not improve motor symptoms at 12 months but showed benefits for some non-motor symptoms. The study represents the first rigorous RCT testing FMT in PD, providing important negative results for motor outcomes while suggesting potential gut-brain axis effects.

**Authors**: Monika Figura et al. (Polish neurologists from Medical University of Warsaw with gastroenterology collaboration, using commercially prepared microbiota (Mbiotix))

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Whether fecal microbiota transplantation can improve motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease through gut-brain axis modulation.
- **Result**: Single FMT did not improve motor symptoms (MDS-UPDRS III) at 12 months but showed some improvements in non-motor symptoms at various timepoints.
- **Open Questions**: Whether repeated FMT treatments, different microbiota preparations, or selection of specific patient subgroups might yield better motor outcomes remains to be determined.

### [Progression independent of relapse and MRI activity and treatment strategies in multiple sclerosis.](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awag060)
★★★ | PIRMA | high-efficacy therapies | multiple sclerosis
**Brain : a journal of neurology**

> Large French registry study of 10,499 MS patients found that high-efficacy therapies (HET) do not meaningfully prevent progression independent of relapse and MRI activity (PIRMA) compared to moderate-efficacy therapies, despite better control of inflammatory activity. This challenges the assumption that more potent anti-inflammatory treatments will prevent all forms of disability progression in MS.

**Authors**: Fabien Rollot et al. (French MS Registry consortium led by researchers from major French MS centers including Lyon and Rennes, representing real-world clinical practice across France)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Whether high-efficacy MS therapies can prevent progression independent of relapse and MRI activity (PIRMA), which represents a major unmet need in MS care.
- **Result**: HET showed no meaningful advantage over moderate-efficacy therapies in preventing PIRMA, despite superior control of relapse-associated and MRI-associated worsening.
- **Open Questions**: The underlying mechanisms driving PIRMA remain unclear, and whether alternative therapeutic strategies beyond current anti-inflammatory approaches might be needed to address this form of progression.

### [Stroke Guideline Expands Adult Treatment, Provides Pediatric Recommendations.](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.26391)
★★★ | stroke guidelines | treatment recommendations | pediatric stroke
**JAMA**

> New stroke guidelines expand treatment options for adult patients while providing specific recommendations for pediatric stroke management. The guidelines likely incorporate recent evidence to broaden therapeutic windows or treatment eligibility criteria for adult stroke interventions.

**Authors**: Samantha Anderer (Not specified)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Updated stroke treatment guidelines were needed to incorporate recent evidence and address gaps in pediatric stroke recommendations.
- **Result**: Guidelines expanded adult stroke treatment criteria and established new pediatric-specific stroke management recommendations.
- **Open Questions**: Specific implementation strategies and real-world outcomes following adoption of these expanded guidelines remain to be evaluated.

### [Deep brain stimulation for epilepsy: optimal targeting and clinical outcomes.](https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2025-337218)
★★★ | deep brain stimulation | drug-resistant epilepsy | thalamic targeting
**Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry**

> This systematic review of 124 studies (1210 patients) demonstrates that precise anatomical targeting in DBS for epilepsy significantly impacts outcomes, with ANT-DBS success correlating with proximity to the mammillothalamic tract junction. The analysis reveals substantial variability in current targeting approaches and provides quantitative evidence that electrode placement precision matters for seizure reduction.

**Authors**: Lauren A Hart et al. (Multi-institutional collaboration led by Harvard/Brigham and Women's epilepsy and neurosurgery teams with established DBS expertise)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Despite multiple DBS targets being used for drug-resistant epilepsy, there was no comprehensive analysis of how precise electrode placement within targets affects clinical outcomes.
- **Result**: Electrode placement accuracy significantly correlates with seizure reduction, particularly for ANT-DBS where closer proximity to mammillothalamic tract junction predicts better outcomes (r=-0.55, p<0.001).
- **Open Questions**: Prospective validation of these targeting relationships and standardization of electrode placement techniques across centers remain to be established.

## Pathophysiology & Mechanisms
*Disease mechanisms, neuropathology, and biomarkers*

### [Characteristic patterns of complement deposition in NMOSD, MOGAD, and MS.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-026-02985-9)
★★★★ | complement deposition | NMOSD pathology | MOGAD subtypes
**Acta neuropathologica**

> Histopathological analysis of CNS tissues reveals distinct complement deposition patterns in NMOSD, MOGAD, and MS that reflect their different pathogenic mechanisms. Most importantly, MOGAD shows two distinct pathological subtypes based on complement activation intensity, with the more destructive type B pattern associated with mortality.

**Authors**: Yoshiki Takai et al. (International collaboration led by Tohoku University (Japan) and Medical University of Vienna neuropathology groups, established experts in inflammatory CNS demyelinating disease pathology)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The role of complement in MOGAD and MS pathogenesis remains unclear despite established complement involvement in NMOSD.
- **Result**: MOGAD exhibits two distinct pathological phenotypes based on complement C9neo deposition intensity, with the more destructive type B pattern (27% of cases) associated with oligodendrocyte loss and increased mortality.
- **Open Questions**: Whether MOGAD pathological subtypes correlate with specific clinical features, treatment responses, or can be predicted by biomarkers in living patients remains unknown.

### [Conformational diversity and fully opening mechanism of native NMDA receptor.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-026-10139-w)
★★★★ | NMDA receptors | channel gating | synaptic transmission
**Nature**

> Researchers used cryo-electron microscopy to resolve ten distinct native NMDAR assemblies from whole mouse brain, revealing previously unknown conformational diversity and a fully open channel state with pore dilation. This structural analysis of native receptors shows GluN2A dominance across assemblies and captures dynamic S-ketamine binding at the channel vestibule.

**Authors**: Ruisheng Xu et al. (Chinese Academy of Sciences structural biology group with expertise in cryo-electron microscopy and neurotransmitter receptor structure)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Previous NMDAR structural studies relied heavily on recombinant receptors rather than native assemblies from whole brain tissue.
- **Result**: Ten distinct native NMDAR assemblies were identified with a novel fully open state showing pore dilation in both GluN1 and GluN2B subunits.
- **Open Questions**: The functional significance of the newly discovered fully open state and its role in pathological conditions remains to be determined.

### [Myelin sheaths in the central nervous system can withstand damage and dynamically remodel.](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adr4661)
★★★★ | myelin swelling | demyelination reversibility | neuronal activity
**Science (New York, N.Y.)**

> This study reveals that myelin damage begins with swelling that can be reversible rather than immediate destruction, challenging the traditional view of demyelination as purely degenerative. Using live imaging in animal models and human MS tissue, researchers found that increased neuronal activity worsens myelin swelling while reduced activity is protective.

**Authors**: Donia Arafa et al. (Edinburgh-based neuroscience consortium with MS Society support, led by investigators from the Institute for Neuroscience and Cardiovascular Research with expertise in myelin biology and regenerative medicine)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The paper addressed how myelin damage actually occurs at the cellular level, as the mechanistic details of demyelination onset remain incompletely understood.
- **Result**: They discovered that early demyelination involves reversible myelin swelling that can resolve and remodel, rather than immediate irreversible destruction, and this process is modulated by neuronal activity levels.
- **Open Questions**: Whether therapeutic interventions targeting neuronal activity or myelin swelling resolution can be developed for human demyelinating diseases remains to be determined.

### [Base barrier cells provide compartmentalization of choroid plexus, brain and CSF.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02188-7)
★★★★ | choroid plexus | blood-brain barrier | neuroinflammation
**Nature neuroscience**

> Researchers discovered a previously unknown barrier cell type at the base of the choroid plexus that compartmentalizes brain, CSF, and peripheral tissues. These base barrier cells (BBCs) lose integrity during inflammation, potentially allowing pathological immune cell infiltration into the CNS.

**Authors**: Daan Verhaege et al. (VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research, Ghent—established European center for CNS barrier and neuroinflammation research)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The anatomical and functional organization of barriers at choroid plexus-brain interfaces remained poorly characterized despite their potential importance in CNS protection.
- **Result**: They identified a distinct population of fibroblast-like barrier cells that form tight junctions at the choroid plexus base and lose barrier function during inflammatory conditions.
- **Open Questions**: The clinical significance of BBC dysfunction in human neurological diseases and whether therapeutic targeting of these cells could modulate CNS inflammation remains to be determined.

### [Loss-of-function variants in the CAPN1 activator CD99L2 cause X-linked spastic ataxia.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69337-9)
★★★★ | X-linked spastic ataxia | CD99L2 | CAPN1 activation
**Nature communications**

> This large-scale genomic study of 2,811 movement disorder patients identified a novel X-linked spastic ataxia caused by loss-of-function variants in CD99L2, a transmembrane protein that activates the calcium-dependent protease CAPN1. The discovery reveals a new disease mechanism involving impaired proteolysis and synaptic dysfunction, while also demonstrating that genome sequencing beyond exomes increases diagnostic yield by 7.5% in movement disorders.

**Authors**: Benita Menden et al. (Multi-institutional European collaboration led by University of Tübingen geneticists with expertise in rare movement disorders and genomic medicine)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The majority of patients with rare movement disorders lack molecular diagnoses despite available genetic testing approaches.
- **Result**: Exome sequencing achieved 19.3% diagnostic yield, genome analysis added 7.5% more diagnoses, and a novel X-linked spastic ataxia gene CD99L2 was discovered through its role in CAPN1 protease activation.
- **Open Questions**: The clinical phenotypic spectrum of CD99L2-related disease and whether CAPN1 pathway modulation could represent a therapeutic target remain to be determined.

### [Dual recruitment of two CCM2 molecules to KRIT1 suppresses KLF4 expression.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69595-7)
★★★★ | cerebral cavernous malformations | KLF4 transcription factor | endothelial dysfunction
**Nature communications**

> This study reveals that two CCM2 proteins must cluster on a single KRIT1 protein to properly suppress KLF4 transcription factor expression in endothelial cells. When this clustering fails due to mutations in either KRIT1 or CCM2, KLF4 overexpression leads to the endothelial dysfunction characteristic of cerebral cavernous malformations.

**Authors**: Clotilde Huet-Calderwood et al. (Yale University pharmacology researchers with expertise in structural biology and protein interactions)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The precise molecular mechanism by which KRIT1 and CCM2 protein interactions regulate endothelial cell function in cerebral cavernous malformations was unclear.
- **Result**: They discovered that exactly two CCM2 molecules must bind to specific NPxF motifs on a single KRIT1 protein to form a functional complex that suppresses pathogenic KLF4 overexpression.
- **Open Questions**: Whether therapeutic strategies targeting this 2:1 CCM2:KRIT1 stoichiometry or downstream KLF4 signaling could prevent or reverse cavernous malformation formation remains to be tested.

### [Adrenoleukodystrophy in adults: phenotypic characterisation and natural history in a large cohort.](https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2025-337540)
★★★ | adrenoleukodystrophy | adrenomyeloneuropathy | ABCD1
**Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry**

> This large Italian cohort of 140 adult ALD patients identifies a distinct intermediate phenotype (ALMN) with worse prognosis than typical AMN, and shows unexpectedly low rates of cerebral progression in Italian AMN patients. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials were consistently abnormal and may help differentiate ALD from hereditary spastic paraplegias in clinical practice.

**Authors**: Chiara Benzoni et al. (Rare neurological diseases specialists from Carlo Besta Institute, Milan - a major European reference center for leukodystrophies)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Adult ALD phenotypic heterogeneity complicates prognosis and clinical trial design, requiring better characterization of disease subtypes and natural history.
- **Result**: They identified adrenoleukomyeloneuropathy (ALMN) as a distinct intermediate phenotype with 4.75x higher mortality than AMN, and found remarkably low cerebral progression rates (7%) in their AMN cohort.
- **Open Questions**: The underlying protective factors preventing cerebral progression in this Italian cohort remain unexplained and require validation in other populations.

### [Towards biomarker-based diagnosis of Parkinson disease.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-026-01185-z)
★★★★ | alpha-synuclein biomarkers | seed amplification assays | Parkinson diagnosis
**Nature reviews. Neurology**

> This comprehensive review examines the potential for α-synuclein seed amplification assays and other biomarkers to revolutionize Parkinson's disease diagnosis by enabling detection before classical motor symptoms appear. The authors discuss emerging biological disease definitions based on these molecular markers and their implications for earlier intervention and personalized treatment approaches.

**Authors**: Eduardo Tolosa et al. (International consortium of leading PD experts from Barcelona, Innsbruck, London, Stockholm, and other major movement disorder centers)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Current clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease are insensitive to early-stage disease and lack validated biomarker-based frameworks for accurate diagnosis.
- **Result**: α-synuclein seed amplification assays can detect pathological protein in CSF and other biofluids at very low levels, potentially enabling pre-motor diagnosis when integrated with clinical, genetic, and imaging biomarkers.
- **Open Questions**: The predictive value of these biomarkers in healthy individuals and those with prodromal PD, as well as their sensitivity to disease progression, requires further validation before clinical implementation.

## Clinical Pearls & Case Reports
*Instructive cases and practical observations*

### [Pearls & Oy-sters: Reversible Leukoencephalopathy and Parkinsonism Due to CNS Involvement in Cryoglobulinemia.](https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214622)
★★★ | cryoglobulinemia | reversible parkinsonism | leukoencephalopathy
**Neurology**

> This case demonstrates that cryoglobulinemic vasculitis can cause reversible parkinsonism and leukoencephalopathy that mimics neurodegenerative disease, responding dramatically to immunosuppression. The patient had type III mixed cryoglobulinemia without typical triggers (hepatitis C or monoclonal gammopathy), presenting with tremor, rigidity, cognitive decline, and extensive white matter changes.

**Authors**: Alexander German et al. (Movement disorders and molecular neurology specialists from University Hospital Erlangen, Germany, with neuroradiology collaboration)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Recognition that cryoglobulinemic vasculitis can masquerade as primary neurodegenerative parkinsonism with white matter involvement.
- **Result**: Complete clinical and radiologic reversal of parkinsonism and leukoencephalopathy following immunosuppressive therapy, with corresponding normalization of serum neurofilament levels.
- **Open Questions**: The optimal screening approach for cryoglobulinemia in patients with rapidly progressive parkinsonism and the frequency of CNS involvement in cryoglobulinemic vasculitis remain unclear.

### [Pearls & Oy-sters: Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia Type 15 Presenting as Juvenile Onset Levodopa-Responsive Parkinsonism.](https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214514)
★★★ | hereditary spastic paraplegia | juvenile parkinsonism | ZFYVE26
**Neurology**

> A 27-year-old man initially diagnosed with juvenile-onset Parkinson's disease and treated with levodopa was ultimately found to have SPG15 (hereditary spastic paraplegia) after progressive loss of dopaminergic responsiveness. This case demonstrates that some forms of HSP can present with parkinsonian features and initial levodopa responsiveness, highlighting the importance of comprehensive genetic testing when atypical features emerge.

**Authors**: Abhilash Thatikala et al. (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences neurology department, movement disorders subspecialty focus)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The diagnostic challenge of distinguishing juvenile-onset parkinsonism from hereditary spastic paraplegia when presentations overlap and initial treatment responses are misleading.
- **Result**: SPG15 can mimic juvenile parkinsonism with initial levodopa responsiveness before progressive loss of benefit and emergence of typical HSP features like spasticity and thin corpus callosum.
- **Open Questions**: The mechanism underlying initial levodopa responsiveness in SPG15 and optimal management strategies for HSP patients with mixed parkinsonian-spastic phenotypes remain unclear.
