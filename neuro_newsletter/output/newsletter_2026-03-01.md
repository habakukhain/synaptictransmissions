*Multicenter trials, meta-analyses, and guidelines*

### [Laser interstitial thermal therapy and adjuvant pembrolizumab in recurrent high-grade astrocytoma: a Phase 1/randomized Phase 2b trial.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69522-w)
★★★★ | laser interstitial thermal therapy | pembrolizumab | recurrent glioblastoma
**Nature communications**

> A phase 2b trial combining laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) with pembrolizumab in recurrent high-grade astrocytoma showed striking survival benefit compared to conventional surgery plus pembrolizumab (median OS 11.8 vs 5.2 months, 18-month survival 42% vs 0%). The study demonstrates that thermal ablation may overcome glioblastoma's notorious immunosuppressive microenvironment by activating monocytes and unleashing CD8+ T cell responses.

**Authors**: Jian L Campian et al. (Multi-institutional team led by neuro-oncologists at Washington University/Siteman Cancer Center with Mayo Clinic collaboration)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown minimal efficacy in recurrent high-grade astrocytoma, likely due to the tumor's immunosuppressive microenvironment.
- **Result**: LITT followed by pembrolizumab dramatically improved survival outcomes compared to standard surgery plus pembrolizumab, with mechanistic evidence of immune activation including non-classical monocyte activation and CD8+ T cell proliferation.
- **Open Questions**: Whether these promising results will hold up in larger randomized trials and how to optimally sequence LITT with immunotherapy remains to be determined.

### [Safety and Effectiveness of Eculizumab in Patients With Refractory Ocular or Ocular-Predominant Myasthenia Gravis: A Case Series.](https://doi.org/10.1002/mus.70183)
★★★ | myasthenia gravis | complement inhibition | ocular symptoms
**Muscle & nerve**

> This case series demonstrates that eculizumab provided rapid and sustained improvement in five patients with refractory ocular or ocular-predominant myasthenia gravis who had failed conventional immunosuppression. All patients showed clinical improvement within one week, with most achieving near-normal function by 4 weeks and maintaining benefits at 12 weeks.

**Authors**: Shiyu Shi et al. (Chinese academic medical center with expertise in geriatric neurology and rare diseases)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: This study addressed the therapeutic challenge of persistent ocular symptoms in myasthenia gravis patients despite conventional immunosuppressive treatment.
- **Result**: All five patients with refractory ocular MG experienced rapid symptom improvement within one week of eculizumab treatment, with sustained benefits at 12 weeks and no adverse events.
- **Open Questions**: Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to establish long-term effectiveness, optimal treatment protocols, and to confirm these promising preliminary results.

### [Timing of Initiation and Efficacy of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Minor Stroke or High-Risk TIA.](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.125.053343)
★★★ | dual antiplatelet therapy | minor stroke timing | therapeutic window
**Stroke**

> This large Korean multicenter study of 41,530 patients with minor stroke or high-risk TIA found that dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) provides maximum benefit only when initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset, with benefits disappearing after 42 hours and potential harm beyond 72 hours. The study provides the first robust evidence for an optimal therapeutic window for DAPT initiation, supporting current guideline recommendations with precise timing data.

**Authors**: Jaemin Shin et al. (Large collaborative Korean stroke consortium from 20 stroke centers with extensive experience in acute stroke management)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The optimal timing window for initiating dual antiplatelet therapy in minor stroke and high-risk TIA patients remained unclear despite guideline recommendations.
- **Result**: DAPT benefit was maximal within 24 hours (HR 0.74), absent between 24-72 hours (HR 1.00), and potentially harmful beyond 72 hours (HR 1.25), with the therapeutic window closing at approximately 42 hours.
- **Open Questions**: Whether these timing effects apply equally across different stroke subtypes, ethnic populations, and whether the mechanism underlying the loss of benefit relates to changing stroke pathophysiology or bleeding risk over time.

### [Switching From Aspirin Monotherapy After Noncardioembolic Stroke: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.125.053030)
★★★ | aspirin failure | secondary stroke prevention | anticoagulation switching
**Stroke**

> This network meta-analysis of 9 trials examined whether patients who have recurrent stroke while on aspirin benefit from switching to alternative antithrombotic therapy. Despite common clinical practice of switching, no alternative therapy (including DOACs, dual antiplatelet therapy, or warfarin) showed statistically significant superiority over continuing aspirin for preventing recurrent stroke.

**Authors**: Aaron Rothstein et al. (University of Pennsylvania stroke researchers with epidemiology expertise, led by experienced stroke neurologists)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: This study addressed the common clinical dilemma of what to do when patients experience ischemic stroke while already on aspirin therapy.
- **Result**: Switching to alternative antithrombotic agents showed a trend toward benefit (RR 0.88) but was not statistically superior to continuing aspirin for preventing recurrent stroke.
- **Open Questions**: Adequately powered randomized trials are still needed to determine if specific switching strategies provide meaningful clinical benefit in this high-risk population.

### [Timing for Starting Antiseizure Medication Withdrawal After Epilepsy Surgery in Adults.](https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214613)
★★★ | epilepsy surgery | antiseizure medication withdrawal | postoperative timing
**Neurology**

> This large multicenter study of 964 adults found that withdrawing antiseizure medications within 2 years after successful epilepsy surgery increases seizure relapse risk compared to waiting longer, but long-term outcomes are similar regardless of withdrawal timing. The findings suggest waiting at least 2 years may reduce early relapse risk, though waiting beyond 2-3 years offers no additional benefit.

**Authors**: Carolina Ferreira-Atuesta et al. (International collaboration led by epilepsy specialists from University Hospital Zurich and Queen Square London, with 12 tertiary epilepsy centers contributing data)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The optimal timing for antiseizure medication withdrawal after successful epilepsy surgery has been unclear, with practices varying widely across centers.
- **Result**: Withdrawing medications in the first 2 years post-surgery increased relapse risk (HR 1.4 for year 1, HR 1.18 for year 2), while withdrawal after year 2 showed no increased risk compared to later withdrawal.
- **Open Questions**: The biological mechanisms underlying why early withdrawal increases relapse risk and whether specific patient subgroups might benefit from different timing strategies remain to be determined.

### [Vasospasm During Endovascular Treatment of Ischemic Stroke: Associated Factors, Impact on Outcomes, and the Effect of Intraarterial Nimodipine.](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.125.053600)
★★★ | endovascular thrombectomy | vasospasm | intraarterial nimodipine
**Stroke**

> This large German registry study of nearly 18,000 stroke patients found that vasospasm during endovascular thrombectomy occurs in 3.2% of cases and significantly worsens outcomes and mortality. Intraarterial nimodipine appears beneficial in reducing early neurological deterioration without safety signals, suggesting vasospasm should be treated aggressively as a serious procedural complication.

**Authors**: Johannes Wischmann et al. (Multi-center German collaboration led by stroke specialists at LMU Munich and Charité Berlin with expertise in endovascular procedures)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The clinical significance of vasospasm during stroke thrombectomy and effectiveness of intraarterial nimodipine treatment remained poorly defined despite affecting up to 20% of patients.
- **Result**: Vasospasm occurred in 3.2% of cases, increased mortality by 35% and worsened functional outcomes, while intraarterial nimodipine reduced early neurological deterioration by 46%.
- **Open Questions**: Whether prophylactic measures can prevent vasospasm in high-risk patients and optimal dosing protocols for intraarterial nimodipine remain undefined.

### [Safety of Physical Activity After Cervical Artery Dissection.](https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.70548)
★★★ | cervical artery dissection | physical activity | recurrence risk
**European journal of neurology**

> This prospective cohort study of 333 cervical artery dissection patients followed for median 6.5 years found that resuming physical activity after dissection was generally safe, with no increased risk of recurrent dissection or cerebral ischemia. However, high-intensity sports showed a trend toward increased dissection recurrence risk that warrants individualized counseling.

**Authors**: Lukas Mayer-Suess et al. (Multi-center European collaboration between specialized stroke centers at Medical University of Innsbruck and University Hospital Basel with established CeAD research programs)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Lack of evidence-based guidance on whether patients can safely resume physical activity after cervical artery dissection.
- **Result**: Physical activity resumption was generally safe with 5.1% recurrence rate over 6.5 years, though high-intensity sports showed a non-significant trend toward increased recurrence risk (OR 3.43, p=0.080).
- **Open Questions**: The threshold for defining 'high-intensity' activity that may pose increased risk requires better characterization in larger studies.

### [Evaluating Prehospital Stroke Scales for Large Vessel Occlusion: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.](https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214484)
★★ | large vessel occlusion | prehospital stroke scales | endovascular thrombectomy
**Neurology**

> This systematic review and network meta-analysis of 58 studies evaluating 33 different stroke scales found that while several scales (LARIO, FPSS, FACE2AD) show strong performance for detecting large vessel occlusion, there is no clear winner that performs optimally across all clinical settings. The analysis highlights the ongoing challenge of reliably identifying LVO patients in prehospital settings for timely endovascular intervention.

**Authors**: Noah Lee Ahmad Nawabi et al. (Multi-institutional collaboration led by Harvard Medical School's Computational Neuroscience Outcomes Center with expertise in stroke outcomes research)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The field lacks consensus on which clinical scale best identifies large vessel occlusion strokes for urgent endovascular thrombectomy in prehospital settings.
- **Result**: Among 33 scales evaluated, performance varied widely with no single scale demonstrating clear superiority across all clinical contexts, though LARIO showed highest overall accuracy (AUC 0.983) and FPSS performed best in prehospital settings (AUC 0.896).
- **Open Questions**: The optimal prehospital LVO detection scale remains undefined, and future research must focus on developing or validating a simple, accurate tool that performs consistently across diverse clinical environments.

## Pathophysiology & Mechanisms
*Disease mechanisms, neuropathology, and biomarkers*

### [Human hippocampal neurogenesis in adulthood, ageing and Alzheimer's disease.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-026-10169-4)
★★★★ | adult neurogenesis | Alzheimer's disease | cognitive resilience
**Nature**

> Using single-cell RNA sequencing on 355,997 hippocampal nuclei from different cognitive cohorts, this study definitively identifies neural stem cells and immature neurons in adult human hippocampus. The research reveals that dysregulated neurogenesis occurs early in preclinical Alzheimer's disease through chromatin accessibility changes, while 'SuperAgers' show a distinct resilience signature that may protect cognitive function.

**Authors**: Ahmed Disouky et al. (University of Illinois Chicago and Northwestern teams with expertise in neuroanatomy, molecular genetics, and cognitive neurology from the Mesulam Alzheimer's Center)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The existence and functional relevance of adult human hippocampal neurogenesis has remained controversial, with unclear molecular mechanisms governing its regulation in aging and Alzheimer's disease.
- **Result**: They identified neural stem cells and neuroblasts in adult human hippocampus and found that chromatin accessibility changes drive early neurogenic dysfunction in preclinical AD, while SuperAgers show protective molecular signatures.
- **Open Questions**: Whether therapeutic interventions targeting these chromatin accessibility pathways could enhance neurogenesis and cognitive resilience in aging or early Alzheimer's disease remains to be tested.

### [COL4A1 and COL4A2 Gene Duplication or Triplication as a Genetic Cause of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease in Adults.](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.125.053813)
★★★★ | COL4A1/COL4A2 | copy number variants | cerebral small vessel disease
**Stroke**

> This study demonstrates that duplications and triplications of COL4A1/COL4A2 genes cause adult-onset cerebral small vessel disease through gene dosage effects, expanding beyond the known pathogenic point mutations. The findings suggest screening for copy number variants should be considered in patients with unexplained cerebral microangiopathy, even without family history.

**Authors**: Dominique Hervé et al. (French reference center for rare cerebrovascular diseases with international collaboration, led by recognized experts in genetic cerebral small vessel disease)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The contribution of copy number gains in COL4A1/COL4A2 genes to adult cerebral small vessel disease was poorly characterized despite known pathogenicity of point mutations.
- **Result**: Seven adult probands with COL4A1/COL4A2 duplications/triplications showed heterogeneous cerebrovascular manifestations and characteristic MRI findings, with only 2 having positive family history.
- **Open Questions**: The precise mechanisms by which gene dosage effects cause pathology and the optimal screening strategies for copy number variants in clinical practice remain to be determined.

### [Alternative Translation Initiation in PRKN Delays the Onset of Parkinson's Disease and Offers a Therapeutic Target.](https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.78180)
★★★★ | PRKN mutations | alternative translation | precision therapy
**Annals of neurology**

> Patients with homozygous PRKN exon 2 deletions develop Parkinson's disease ~8 years later than those with other PRKN mutations due to production of a truncated but partially functional Parkin protein via alternative translation initiation. This residual protein function can be pharmacologically enhanced with small molecule modulators, offering a genotype-specific therapeutic approach.

**Authors**: Arian Hach et al. (International collaboration led by Institute of Neurogenetics, University of Lübeck, with expertise in movement disorders genetics and cellular modeling)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Why some PRKN mutation carriers have delayed Parkinson's disease onset compared to others with the same gene affected.
- **Result**: Exon 2 deletions allow production of a truncated Parkin protein (lacking amino acids 1-79) that retains partial ubiquitin ligase activity and delays disease onset.
- **Open Questions**: Whether this genotype-stratified approach with Parkin modulators will prove clinically effective and how to optimize patient selection given the drug's inhibitory effects on wild-type Parkin.

### [Epigenomic subtypes of late-onset Alzheimer's disease reveal distinct microglial signatures.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-026-02990-y)
★★★★ | Alzheimer's subtypes | DNA methylation | microglial heterogeneity
**Acta neuropathologica**

> This large postmortem study of 826 brains identified two distinct epigenomic subtypes of late-onset Alzheimer's disease based on DNA methylation patterns, each characterized by different microglial activation signatures. Subtype 1 shows predominantly inflammatory microglial programs while subtype 2 exhibits stronger regulatory and clearance functions, suggesting the need for personalized therapeutic approaches targeting specific microglial states.

**Authors**: Valentin T Laroche et al. (Multi-institutional European collaboration from Maastricht University and University of Exeter with expertise in neuropsychiatry, computational biology, and epigenomics)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The clinical and pathological heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease may explain variable therapeutic outcomes and trial failures, necessitating molecular subtyping beyond traditional amyloid and tau pathology.
- **Result**: Two reproducible epigenomic subtypes were identified across three cohorts, each with distinct microglial methylation patterns and corresponding transcriptional programs—one inflammatory-dominant and one regulatory/clearance-dominant.
- **Open Questions**: Whether these epigenomic subtypes can be detected in living patients through accessible biomarkers and whether targeted therapies based on microglial subtype will improve clinical outcomes.

### [Large-scale proteomics across neurological disorders uncovers biomarker panel and targets in multiple sclerosis.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2026.01.017)
★★★★ | CSF proteomics | multiple sclerosis biomarkers | mass spectrometry diagnostics
**Cell**

> Researchers developed a high-throughput mass spectrometry platform to analyze cerebrospinal fluid proteomes across 5,000 neurological patients, identifying a 22-protein panel that distinguishes multiple sclerosis from other inflammatory CNS diseases with superior performance to current markers. The approach also enables proteome-based staging along the relapsing-progressive MS spectrum and identifies novel therapeutic targets.

**Authors**: Jakob Maximilian Bader et al. (Max Planck Institute proteomics experts collaborating with Technical University of Munich neurologists, representing a strong translational partnership between basic proteomics and clinical neurology)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Current CSF biomarkers are insufficient for distinguishing multiple sclerosis from other inflammatory neurological diseases, particularly in diagnostically challenging cases.
- **Result**: A validated 22-protein panel outperformed established CSF markers in differentiating MS from related inflammatory diseases and successfully staged patients along the relapsing-progressive disease spectrum.
- **Open Questions**: Clinical implementation feasibility, cost-effectiveness compared to current diagnostic approaches, and prospective validation in real-world diagnostic scenarios remain to be established.

### [Parkinson's disease affects network of brain regions that controls whole-body action.](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00573-1)
★★★ | Parkinson's disease | motor networks | whole-body movement
**Nature**

> This Nature study reveals that Parkinson's disease affects a broader network of brain regions controlling coordinated whole-body actions, extending beyond traditional basal ganglia circuits. The findings suggest PD motor dysfunction involves more distributed neural networks than previously appreciated, potentially explaining complex movement patterns and gait disturbances.

**Authors**: Authors not listed (Not specified)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The neural basis of complex whole-body movement deficits in Parkinson's disease beyond classical basal ganglia dysfunction remains poorly understood.
- **Result**: Parkinson's disease disrupts a distributed network of brain regions that coordinate whole-body motor actions, not just focal basal ganglia circuits.
- **Open Questions**: The therapeutic implications of targeting these broader motor networks and how this relates to treatment response variability needs investigation.

### [Personalized brain decoding of spontaneous pain in individuals with chronic pain.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-026-02221-3)
★★★ | spontaneous pain | precision neuroimaging | chronic pain biomarkers
**Nature neuroscience**

> Researchers developed personalized fMRI-based models that could accurately decode spontaneous pain intensity in two chronic pain patients using extensive longitudinal brain imaging data collected over 6+ months. The models were highly individual-specific and required substantial amounts of training data to achieve predictive accuracy, suggesting that objective pain assessment may be possible but requires personalized approaches.

**Authors**: Jae-Joong Lee et al. (South Korean neuroscience imaging researchers from Institute for Basic Science with expertise in computational neuroimaging and pain neuroscience)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Chronic pain assessment relies entirely on subjective reporting due to the lack of objective biomarkers for spontaneous pain.
- **Result**: Personalized fMRI decoding models achieved moderate-to-good accuracy (r=0.40-0.65) in predicting spontaneous pain fluctuations, but each model was entirely patient-specific and non-generalizable.
- **Open Questions**: Whether this approach can be scaled beyond intensive research settings and validated in larger patient populations with diverse chronic pain conditions.

### [Low-Field Portable MRI Detects Developmental Pattern of Ultraearly Cerebral Infarction in aSAH.](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.125.052474)
★★★ | portable MRI | subarachnoid hemorrhage | delayed cerebral ischemia
**Stroke**

> Low-field portable MRI detected ultraearly cerebral infarction in 14% of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients within 72 hours of onset. Patients with ultraearly infarction had 3-fold higher risk of poor functional outcomes and 7-fold higher risk of delayed cerebral ischemia.

**Authors**: Tengfei Yu et al. (Beijing Tiantan Hospital neurosurgery team, a major Chinese cerebrovascular center with Georgia Tech collaboration)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The lack of practical bedside imaging tools to detect ultraearly ischemic changes in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients that could predict clinical outcomes.
- **Result**: Portable low-field MRI successfully identified ultraearly infarction as an independent predictor of both delayed cerebral ischemia and poor functional outcomes in aSAH.
- **Open Questions**: Whether early detection of ultraearly infarction could guide targeted interventions to prevent delayed cerebral ischemia remains unexplored.

### [Extended CTA scan range for early detection of left atrial and left atrial appendage thrombus and other filling defects in acute ischemic stroke.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-026-13692-6)
★★★ | cardioembolic stroke | CT angiography | atrial thrombus
**Journal of neurology**

> Extending CTA scan range to include the left atrium and left atrial appendage during acute stroke workup identified thrombus-suggestive filling defects in 2% of patients and non-well-defined defects in 11%. Both findings were associated with more severe strokes, higher mortality, and increased likelihood of atrial fibrillation, suggesting early cardiac imaging may have therapeutic implications.

**Authors**: Juan Marta-Enguita et al. (Stroke neurologists from Hospital Universitario Donostia, Spain, part of the Spanish stroke research network (RICORS-Ictus))

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Current acute stroke CTA protocols may miss cardiac sources of embolism that could influence early treatment decisions and anticoagulation strategies.
- **Result**: Extended CTA detected cardiac filling defects in 13% of acute stroke patients, with these findings strongly predicting worse outcomes and underlying atrial fibrillation even when patients were already anticoagulated.
- **Open Questions**: Whether early detection of these cardiac abnormalities should alter acute treatment protocols or anticoagulation management remains to be prospectively studied.
