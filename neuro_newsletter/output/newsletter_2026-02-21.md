*Multicenter trials, meta-analyses, and guidelines*

### [An Antibody-Oligonucleotide Conjugate for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1.](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2407326)
★★★★ | myotonic dystrophy | antibody-oligonucleotide conjugate | RNA targeting
**The New England journal of medicine**

> A phase 1-2 trial of delpacibart etedesiran, an antibody-oligonucleotide conjugate that targets transferrin receptor 1 to deliver RNA interference to muscle, showed successful reduction of toxic DMPK mRNA (37-46%) and improvement in aberrant splicing patterns in myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients. This represents the first demonstration of effective muscle delivery and molecular correction for this progressive neuromuscular disease with no approved therapies.

**Authors**: Nicholas E Johnson et al. (Multi-institutional collaboration led by established myotonic dystrophy researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University and University of Rochester, partnering with Avidity Biosciences who developed the conjugate technology)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: This study addressed the lack of effective therapies for myotonic dystrophy type 1 by testing a novel approach to reduce the toxic RNA that causes the disease's characteristic splicing abnormalities.
- **Result**: The drug successfully reduced muscle DMPK mRNA levels by 37-46% and improved composite missplicing scores by 16-17% in higher dose groups, with proportional pharmacokinetics but two serious adverse events.
- **Open Questions**: Long-term safety, clinical efficacy on functional outcomes, and optimal dosing regimens require investigation in larger phase 3 trials before this approach can become standard therapy.

★★★★ | brain metastases | stereotactic radiosurgery | hippocampal avoidance
**JAMA**

> This phase 3 randomized trial of 196 patients with 5-20 brain metastases compared stereotactic radiation targeting individual tumors versus hippocampal-avoidance whole brain radiation. Stereotactic radiation significantly improved patient-reported symptom severity and daily functioning interference compared to whole brain radiation, with similar safety profiles.

**Authors**: Ayal A Aizer et al. (Multi-institutional collaboration led by Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's radiation oncology with biostatistics expertise from Harvard Chan School)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The optimal radiation approach for patients with 5-20 brain metastases was unknown, representing a critical treatment decision point between focal and whole brain approaches.
- **Result**: Stereotactic radiation provided clinically meaningful improvement in symptom burden and daily functioning compared to hippocampal-avoidance whole brain radiation without increased toxicity.
- **Open Questions**: Long-term cognitive outcomes, overall survival differences, and optimal treatment strategies for patients with >20 metastases remain to be determined.

### [Rapid efficacy of efgartigimod for generalized myasthenia gravis patients in acute exacerbations/worsening: multicenter real-world retrospective study.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-026-13695-3)
★★★ | myasthenia gravis | efgartigimod | acute exacerbation
**Journal of neurology**

> This multicenter retrospective study of 61 generalized myasthenia gravis patients showed that efgartigimod achieved rapid clinical improvement in 82% of patients after just one infusion during acute exacerbations, with 98% showing meaningful improvement by 4 weeks. The study supports efgartigimod as a fast-acting therapeutic option for high-risk MG patients, including those with myasthenic crisis red flags.

**Authors**: Jing Lin et al. (Multiple Chinese academic neurology centers including Tongji Hospital and military medical university affiliates with neuromuscular expertise)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The need to establish whether efgartigimod can serve as a rapid-acting intervention for myasthenia gravis patients experiencing acute exacerbations before they progress to life-threatening crisis.
- **Result**: Efgartigimod produced clinically meaningful improvement in 82% of patients after a single dose and 98% after 4 weeks, with substantial reductions in disability scores and no serious adverse events.
- **Open Questions**: Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to definitively establish efgartigimod's superiority over standard acute treatments like PLEX or IVIG in this setting.

### [Rescue intracranial stenting for failed mechanical thrombectomy of vertebrobasilar occlusions: a pooled analysis from the French and German national stroke registries.](https://doi.org/10.1136/jnis-2025-023207)
★★★ | vertebrobasilar occlusion | rescue intracranial stenting | mechanical thrombectomy
**Journal of neurointerventional surgery**

> This large registry study of over 2000 patients shows that rescue intracranial stenting after failed mechanical thrombectomy in vertebrobasilar occlusions significantly improves functional outcomes and reduces mortality without increasing hemorrhagic complications. The findings provide level 3 evidence supporting rescue stenting as a viable option when standard thrombectomy fails in posterior circulation strokes.

**Authors**: Victoria Lambrou et al. (International collaboration from major stroke centers in France and Germany with access to national stroke registries)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Whether rescue intracranial stenting should be performed when mechanical thrombectomy fails in vertebrobasilar occlusions remains unclear.
- **Result**: Rescue stenting after failed thrombectomy increased odds of good functional outcome (mRS 0-3) by 3.45-fold and reduced 90-day mortality without increasing hemorrhagic risk.
- **Open Questions**: Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to definitively validate the benefits and establish optimal patient selection criteria for rescue stenting.

### [Flow diversion for posterior circulation intracranial aneurysms: a systematic review and meta-analysis.](https://doi.org/10.1136/jnis-2025-023190)
★★★ | flow diverters | posterior circulation aneurysms | endovascular treatment
**Journal of neurointerventional surgery**

> This meta-analysis of 1760 posterior circulation aneurysms treated with flow diverters shows 73% complete occlusion rates but concerning 12% thromboembolic event rates and 8% mortality. Flow diverters appear less effective for fusiform-dolichoectatic aneurysms (48% occlusion) compared to other morphologies.

**Authors**: Anderson Brito et al. (Multidisciplinary team from University of Iowa with expertise in neurology, neurosurgery, and neurointerventional procedures)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The safety and efficacy of flow diverters for posterior circulation aneurysms remained poorly defined compared to their established role in anterior circulation.
- **Result**: Flow diverters achieve reasonable occlusion rates (73%) in posterior circulation aneurysms but carry higher risks than typically seen in anterior circulation, particularly for fusiform-dolichoectatic lesions.
- **Open Questions**: Optimal patient selection criteria and whether alternative treatments might be safer for high-risk posterior circulation aneurysm subtypes remain unclear.

### [Endovascular thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion stroke in patients with pre-existing disability.](https://doi.org/10.1136/jnis-2025-023208)
★★★ | endovascular thrombectomy | pre-existing disability | modified Rankin Scale
**Journal of neurointerventional surgery**

> This large registry study of 1,489 patients shows that endovascular thrombectomy is safe and effective in stroke patients with pre-existing disability (mRS 2-5), with higher odds of returning to baseline function compared to previously healthy patients. The findings challenge current practice patterns that may exclude disabled patients from thrombectomy consideration.

**Authors**: Sai Polineni et al. (Mount Sinai and Northwell neurosurgery departments with established stroke intervention programs)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Current stroke trials exclude patients with pre-existing disability, leaving uncertainty about thrombectomy safety and efficacy in this common population (one-third of stroke patients).
- **Result**: Patients with baseline disability had nearly 3-fold higher odds of returning to their premorbid functional status after thrombectomy, with no increased risk of hemorrhage or mortality.
- **Open Questions**: Whether these registry findings would be replicated in randomized controlled trials and what optimal patient selection criteria should be for disabled patients.

### [Intravascular lithotripsy in calcified carotid stenosis: technical and clinical outcomes.](https://doi.org/10.1136/jnis-2025-024532)
★★★ | intravascular lithotripsy | carotid stenosis | calcified plaque
**Journal of neurointerventional surgery**

> This systematic review of 120 patients shows that intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) achieves 100% technical success in treating heavily calcified carotid stenosis, with 84% achieving residual stenosis ≤30% and only 5.8% experiencing stroke/TIA within 30 days. The technique uses localized shockwave pulses to fracture vascular calcium, potentially offering a solution for high-risk patients with complex calcified plaques who are poor candidates for standard revascularization.

**Authors**: Diego Alejandro Hernandez Langarica et al. (Neurosurgery departments at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Standard surgical and endovascular approaches to carotid stenosis are limited by heavily calcified plaques that increase procedural risk.
- **Result**: IVL demonstrated 100% technical success with favorable short-term safety profile in treating calcified carotid stenosis across 15 studies.
- **Open Questions**: Randomized controlled trials are needed to definitively establish IVL's role compared to standard revascularization techniques in clinical practice.

### [Contrast-Associated Acute Kidney Injury After Thrombectomy for Ischemic Stroke: Prognostic Impact and CAN-REST Predictive Score.](https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214655)
★★★ | contrast-associated acute kidney injury | endovascular thrombectomy | CAN-REST score
**Neurology**

> This large international study of 6,638 stroke patients undergoing thrombectomy found that contrast-associated acute kidney injury occurs in 4.9% of cases and significantly worsens outcomes including mortality and disability. The authors developed a validated 12-variable predictive score (CAN-REST) using routine clinical parameters to identify high-risk patients before the procedure.

**Authors**: Ghil Schwarz et al. (Large international collaboration across 73 centers in 16 countries, led by stroke centers in Switzerland, Italy, and statistical experts from University College London)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The incidence, clinical impact, and risk prediction of contrast-associated acute kidney injury in stroke patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy was poorly characterized.
- **Result**: CA-AKI affects 1 in 20 thrombectomy patients and independently predicts higher mortality, worse functional outcomes, and severe disability, with a validated risk score achieving good discrimination (AUC 0.71).
- **Open Questions**: Whether implementing this risk score with targeted preventive strategies (hydration protocols, contrast minimization) can actually reduce CA-AKI incidence and improve outcomes requires prospective validation.

## Pathophysiology & Mechanisms
*Disease mechanisms, neuropathology, and biomarkers*

### [Predicting onset of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease with plasma p-tau217 clocks.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-026-04206-y)
★★★★ | plasma p-tau217 | Alzheimer's prediction | biomarker clock
**Nature medicine**

> Researchers developed a blood-based 'clock' using plasma p-tau217 levels that can predict when cognitively normal individuals will develop Alzheimer's symptoms, with accuracy within 3-4 years. The time from biomarker positivity to symptom onset is shorter in older individuals, suggesting age-dependent disease acceleration.

**Authors**: Kellen K Petersen et al. (Washington University St. Louis and UCSF collaboration, institutions with leading Alzheimer's biomarker research programs)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: Current methods cannot predict when asymptomatic individuals will develop Alzheimer's symptoms, limiting clinical trial design and future patient counseling.
- **Result**: A single plasma p-tau217 test can predict Alzheimer's symptom onset within 3.0-3.7 years median error, with the biomarker-to-symptom interval being shorter in older patients.
- **Open Questions**: Whether this predictive accuracy holds across diverse populations and how it might be integrated into clinical decision-making and patient care remains to be determined.

### [Brain-wide mapping of oligodendrocyte organization, oligodendrogenesis, and myelin injury.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2026.01.025)
★★★★ | oligodendrocyte mapping | myelin dynamics | demyelinating disease
**Cell**

> Researchers developed an AI-assisted brain-wide mapping technique to precisely locate millions of oligodendrocytes and assess myelin density across the mouse lifespan. The study revealed consistent regional patterns of oligodendrocyte distribution with age-specific changes and identified areas of enhanced vulnerability in demyelination models and Alzheimer's disease.

**Authors**: Yu Kang T Xu et al. (Johns Hopkins and Harvard neuroscience teams with expertise in oligodendrocyte biology and advanced imaging techniques)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The field lacked comprehensive understanding of oligodendrocyte distribution patterns and myelin dynamics across different brain regions throughout the lifespan.
- **Result**: They created detailed atlases showing region-specific oligodendrocyte patterns that are consistent across individuals and sexes but vary with age, and identified areas of differential vulnerability in disease models.
- **Open Questions**: Translation to human brain mapping and whether these vulnerability patterns predict clinical demyelinating disease progression or treatment response remains to be determined.

### [Liver exerkine reverses aging- and Alzheimer's-related memory loss via vasculature.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2026.01.024)
★★★★ | GPLD1 | blood-brain barrier | exercise neuroprotection
**Cell**

> Researchers identified GPLD1, a liver-derived enzyme released during exercise, that improves cognitive function in aging and Alzheimer's disease by modulating brain blood vessel function. The mechanism involves cleaving tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) on cerebral blood vessels, which restores blood-brain transport and rescues memory deficits.

**Authors**: Gregor Bieri et al. (UCSF Department of Anatomy research group with established expertise in aging neurobiology and exercise-mediated neuroprotection)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The molecular mechanisms by which exercise benefits brain function in aging and neurodegeneration remained poorly understood, limiting therapeutic development.
- **Result**: GPLD1 acts as a liver-to-brain exercise factor that cleaves vascular TNAP to restore blood-brain barrier transport and reverse cognitive decline in aged and Alzheimer model mice.
- **Open Questions**: Whether GPLD1 or TNAP inhibition strategies will translate to human cognitive benefits and what the optimal dosing and delivery methods would be clinically.

### [Decoding Alzheimer's disease through down syndrome: insights from a genetically defined population.](https://doi.org/10.1097/WCO.0000000000001461)
★★★★ | Down syndrome | Alzheimer biomarkers | amyloid staging
**Current opinion in neurology**

> This review demonstrates how Down syndrome provides a unique genetic model for understanding Alzheimer's disease, with near-universal AD neuropathology by age 40 and predictable biomarker trajectories that mirror sporadic AD. The genetically determined nature of DS-AD enables precise staging and early intervention strategies that can inform broader AD therapeutic approaches.

**Authors**: Jason K Russell et al. (Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute, USC—leading AD research center with expertise in clinical trials and biomarker development)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The need for better understanding of AD natural history and biomarker evolution to enable earlier detection and intervention strategies.
- **Result**: DS-AD demonstrates predictable trajectories of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration decades before dementia onset, with biomarker patterns that closely align with sporadic AD but follow a more compressed timeline.
- **Open Questions**: Whether therapeutic interventions based on DS-AD insights will successfully translate to sporadic AD populations remains to be proven in ongoing clinical trials.

### [SNUPN variants cause spinocerebellar atrophy by disrupting global splicing in cerebellar Purkinje cells.](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaf348)
★★★ | SNUPN | spinocerebellar ataxia | RNA splicing
**Brain : a journal of neurology**

> This study identifies SNUPN gene mutations as a novel cause of spinocerebellar ataxia through disrupted RNA splicing in Purkinje cells, expanding the phenotypic spectrum beyond the previously known limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Using knock-in mice, the authors demonstrate that snurportin-1 dysfunction impairs U1 snRNP nuclear transport, leading to widespread splicing defects and cerebellar developmental abnormalities.

**Authors**: Mariko Okubo et al. (National Institute of Neuroscience, Tokyo - established neuromuscular research center with strong track record in genetic ataxia research)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The CNS consequences of SNUPN mutations were unknown despite their established role in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy through RNA splicing defects.
- **Result**: SNUPN mutations cause spinocerebellar ataxia through impaired nuclear transport of U1 snRNPs, leading to widespread splicing dysregulation specifically affecting Purkinje cell development and function.
- **Open Questions**: The frequency of SNUPN mutations in unexplained spinocerebellar ataxia cohorts and potential therapeutic approaches targeting splicing dysfunction remain to be determined.

### [Ultra High-Resolution Ultrasound Features of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in Transthyretin Amyloidosis: A Cross-Sectional Study.](https://doi.org/10.1002/mus.70181)
★★★ | transthyretin amyloidosis | carpal tunnel syndrome | ultra high-resolution ultrasound
**Muscle & nerve**

> Ultra high-resolution ultrasound reveals distinctive findings in ATTR-related carpal tunnel syndrome, including hyperechoic areas within median nerves and thickened paraneural tissue, even when nerve cross-sectional area appears normal. These findings suggest ultrasound could help identify ATTR patients presenting with CTS as their initial symptom, potentially enabling earlier systemic diagnosis.

**Authors**: Rachana K Gandhi Mehta et al. (Multi-institutional collaboration led by Wake Forest Baptist neuromuscular specialists with UNC collaborators)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: The lack of specialized imaging characterization for ATTR-related CTS, which often precedes systemic symptoms by years and represents a missed diagnostic opportunity.
- **Result**: ATTR-CTS showed unique ultrasonographic features including hyperechoic median nerve areas, thickened hyperechoic paraneural tissue, and increased flexor retinaculum echogenicity, with 13 nerves showing normal cross-sectional area despite clinical CTS.
- **Open Questions**: Whether these ultrasound patterns are specific to ATTR-CTS versus other causes, and if they can be validated as a diagnostic screening tool in larger cohorts.

## Clinical Pearls & Case Reports
*Instructive cases and practical observations*

### [Pearls & Oy-sters: SCA27B as an Elusive Genetic Cause of Episodic Neurologic Symptoms in Later Adulthood.](https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214754)
★★★ | SCA27B | episodic ataxia | intronic repeat expansion
**Neurology**

> SCA27B, caused by GAA repeat expansions in FGF14, accounts for 10-60% of late-onset cerebellar ataxia cases and commonly presents with episodic neurologic symptoms that can mislead clinicians initially. The intronic location of the pathogenic variant means standard panel/exome testing will miss this diagnosis, requiring specific repeat analysis or whole-genome sequencing.

**Authors**: Jacob Yomtoob et al. (Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine neurology specialists including experts from the Denning Ataxia Center)

**Critical Evaluation**:
- **Problem**: SCA27B is frequently misdiagnosed due to its episodic presentation and the limitation of standard genetic testing to detect deep intronic repeat expansions.
- **Result**: Two cases demonstrate how SCA27B can present with episodic symptoms years before progressive ataxia becomes apparent, and how standard genetic panels fail to detect this condition.
- **Open Questions**: The optimal testing strategy and timing for suspected SCA27B remains unclear, particularly in patients with episodic symptoms but normal interictal examination and imaging.
