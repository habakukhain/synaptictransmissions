# Institutional proxy settings
# Configure this section to access paywalled content via your institution
proxy:
  enabled: false

  # Option 1: EZProxy-style URL prefix
  # Your library's EZProxy will have a URL like: https://proxy.library.edu/login?url=
  # The target URL gets appended to this prefix
  url: null  # e.g., "https://proxy.library.edu/login?url="

  # Option 2: HTTP/HTTPS proxy
  # Some institutions provide a direct proxy server
  http_proxy: null   # e.g., "http://proxy.institution.edu:8080"
  https_proxy: null  # e.g., "http://proxy.institution.edu:8080"

  # Proxy authentication (if required)
  username: null
  password: null

  # Note: For many institutions, you may need to:
  # 1. Be on the campus network or VPN
  # 2. Use your institution's EZProxy URL (Option 1)
  # 3. Configure browser-style proxy (Option 2)
  #
  # Common EZProxy URL patterns:
  # - https://proxy.library.edu/login?url=
  # - https://ezproxy.library.edu/login?url=
  # - https://login.proxy.library.edu/login?url=
  #
  # Contact your library for the correct proxy URL
